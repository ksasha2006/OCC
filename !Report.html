I give help to some of them at work, we go to others because they live in nearby villages and do not have a car. It's nice to receive good feedback from them. And we have already given help to some, but it was 40 days ago, when the war started, and they have already eaten everything - they are asking for more.

Thank God! In the dark, bright people are very visible. In His Sermon on the Mount, Christ called his disciples and followers to be a light to the world. At this difficult time, it is important for our country to receive help and support from sincere people and those who care about Ukraine. On behalf of TOBO "Heart of Mercy" we express our sincere gratitude to the sponsors and partners of PRD. We are pleased to understand that in this trouble we are not alone, but you are with us in your prayers and material support. We directed our work in several directions: 1. Providing assistance to people affected by hostilities personally 2. Cooperation with churches and other public organizations to help and support refugees from military aggression. For many years, our charity has been providing humanitarian aid to socially vulnerable groups in Ukraine. This experience contributed to the establishment of mechanisms in these difficult times of war. Several testimonies about the people we met and helped as much as possible: 1. Eugene, a resident of Kharkiv in the past participated in the anti-terrorist operation, living in Kharkov had a car, house, apartment, his wife had his own dentistry. In a few days he lost everything, got by evacuation train to Ternopil and was at the refugee reception point on the street. Textile, all he had left was the clothes he was wearing (sports pants, torn sneakers, a thin jacket) and a small backpack with documents without finances for subsistence, he had only 200 hryvnias. And the opportunity to be at the refugee reception center 3 days. What was done: Clothes were provided: new sneakers (autumn-winter), winter jacket, new jeans, personal hygiene products (toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, shaving products), financial assistance for travel to Lviv with further arrival to Novovolynsk, Volyn region. In a few days he had the opportunity to go abroad where he met his wife and will build a new life without war. 2. Many people responded to help for IDPs and were ready to receive them in their homes. Since most migrants do not have the finances for their livelihood, buying food, clothing, etc. decided to support them with food kits that included basic foods (rice, pasta, cereals, stews, flour, sugar, etc.). 3. Together with the Local Church "Druzhba" in Ternopil, assistance was provided in the reception, nutrition, spiritual and psychological support of people affected by the war. Every night, 50 to 200 refugees are received at the House of Prayer. 4.. Together with the Church in Zbarazh, material assistance was provided to more than 40 migrants from Mariupol who left the blockade. Clothes and food were provided, a house was rented, cosmetic repairs were made to improve living conditions, mattresses and utensils were provided for comfortable living.

Since the beginning of the war, our church has not shied away from the needs and problems of the people. After the first explosions in our city, we opened the doors of the church building as a shelter for the locals during air raids. We tried to support everyone morally and spiritually. When evacuated people from the battlefields began to arrive in the west, we made dozens of flights to bring them to Lutsk. For their temporary stay, we turned the classrooms of our private school, which is located in the church building, into living rooms. We are also actively evacuating people by church transport from hotspots. We have already made four passenger bus flights to Dnipro and Druzhkivka and evacuated more than 200 people. By the way, one flight costs us approximately 35 thousand UAH. Now we accept from 50 to 100 people in the church. We provide them with three meals a day, help them find housing, and transport those who want to go abroad. Also, every week we provide migrants with food kits, help with medicines and personal hygiene products. With your help, we have the opportunity to refuel for regular travel, buy groceries and help the displaced. As the front line is constantly changing and the flow of migrants does not stop, we are ready to continue to serve and help people, not only physically but also in their spiritual needs. We are sincerely grateful for your love for Ukrainians and care for us in this difficult time. Thank you for not staying away, but for finding the opportunity to serve our needs. Your love and faith in practical help is inspiring.

Our local church in Velykyi Bereznyi, the pastor and the whole team of volunteers are sincerely grateful to the brother of the President of the Samaritan Bag Project Franklin Graham for the timely financial support provided to us. We used the funds for their intended purpose, namely to feed and heat the IDPs on the border of the Ublya checkpoint, which is a few kilometers from the location of our church. We transported (evacuated) and organized the entry of migrants to other European countries (Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Norway and others). We continue to work. We provide living space (temporarily and permanently, with all the conditions, food, heat.) Distribute food kits to all those in need. We hold entertainment classes with children, meetings with women. We provide assistance to the Armed Forces. We hold daily prayer meetings in the church. We are sincerely grateful to God for our country Ukraine, for His mercy, for faith and hope that we will be Jesus in heaven????????????

Today there are many families in our town who have been forced to leave their homes because they are now under occupation. Last week, three families turned to us for help. We were able to provide them with food, a children's office and medicine. They also bought clothes for the children. Because they came as a family with one backpack. We also then invited them to serve. And they accepted the invitation, and on Sunday all with the children were at the feast of "Jesus' entry into Jerusalem." Even in such difficult times, God works great miracles. Glory to Him for everything! We are sincerely grateful for your heart that cares about the people of our country

For we are His creation, created in Christ Jesus for the good works that God intended us to do. (Ephesians 2:10) Each of us today can be a testimony of practical service to people with a mission proclaimed by the Samaritan Bag Project to "show love in tangible form with the local churches." During the war, since our church received funds from the project, we have been able to help about 1,000 people in various forms of help: medicine, evacuation, clothing, food, prayer, study of God's word, just keep quiet and listen to the pain a person has experienced. . God is wonderful! For He opens your hearts to help hundreds of thousands of people, and to show His love for them in a tangible way. Thank you for a wonderful example of service. We saw the shining eyes of children rejoicing in the gift, we saw tears in the eyes of grandparents who were left alone in distant villages and needed help, we prayed with those who were able to leave the occupied city and moved to our town in search of temporary accommodation. we helped expectant mothers who could not gather at the maternity hospital, we felt the strong hugs of those who were evacuated, prayed for our defenders at the checkpoints, giving them hot drinks, food, cried with the women whose husbands went to protect and with them lost touch ... it was all possible thanks to your open heart and the financial help you gave us. May the Lord preserve and bless you!

With these finances, food packages were made which were delivered to hot spots, after deoccupation, and beads were refueled to deliver this help! During this time, 1,500 people were accepted and sent away (fed, given clothes, food and delivery to the border)! People who received food packages are Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Kyiv regions (in the first days after deoccupation)! This report is written in a bus that is currently delivering aid (in the amount of 200 food packages, two such buses) in the village of Bashtanka, 15 km from the fighting! May the Lord reward

Many thanks to God and the mission of the Samaritan Bag, for the funds that were sent to our organization to help other people in this difficult time for Ukraine. Thanks to these funds, our public organization "Family Above All" was able to evacuate many people from Kyiv, Kherson from the Mykolaiv region, most women and children. Also at the expense of these funds many products and medicines were purchased and transported to the occupied territories, where, unfortunately, there is already a shortage of medicines, and the prices are high, it is difficult for people who lose their jobs to buy them. pass on help. We are currently serving the people with clothes, homes and food. Our center served as a shelter, during the heavy shelling, many unbelievers came there, we had the opportunity to testify to people about God and some of them accepted this Good News, Glory to God! Thanks to the funds received, we were able to cover the expenses that were spent to serve the people in the shelter. God bless you!

When we heard the news that about 50 families with children had been resettled in our kindergarten, who were forced to leave their homes due to the occupation of Snihurivka, we immediately knew what to do - go there. We prepared a children's program, bought children sweets, apples and took gifts and went to kindergarten. The emotions we saw there are incredible. One girl opened the gift, saw a spoon and began to kiss her, as if it were the most precious treasure in her life. Another girl rejoiced at her gift, telling her mother, "Look at my towel and comb." Such simple things brought such sincere emotions to the children who left home without toys, things, to a safer place ... It was a wonderful day ... parents of children be ready to communicate, we prayed together for them. Unfortunately, we could not spend more time together, because the next day these people were evacuated to safer cities in Ukraine. But thanks to these gifts, we were able to show the children almost how much Jesus loves them

Assistance provided by the Mission was received by 73 people. Some of these people are members of the local Christian church Covenant of Grace. The second part is people from the world with whom there is a connection and relationship. All people receiving assistance live in the city of Nikolaev. Mostly they are family people and pensioners. Retirees living alone. Because of the war, each of these people faced a deep state of material need. People are younger, have lost their jobs and have no or limited livelihoods. Older people are under intense pressure to struggle both with health problems and with the ability to support themselves in matters of subsistence. As an example, the first three weeks of the war dealt such a blow to the life of the city of Nikolaev that people could not go out because of fear. There were no supplies of food and medicines to the city. Some pensioners could not afford food for several days. It was also a problem for couples with small children. Shrapnel from shells crawled into the houses of several people after shelling the city. Windows were shattered, doors were broken. Experiencing a strong pressure of fear, people were on the verge of despair. The situation with help brought much encouragement and revived the hearts of the people in the hope of God. Since everyone is asking for His mercy and help. Coming to people and bringing them food, we witnessed tears and prayers of gratitude. Constant assistance with food, medicines is extremely important for people in the city of Nikolaev and its environs. The city is at the forefront of hostilities. Every day people face shelling. Food, clothes, medicines give hope for survival and preservation of the life given by God. with respect and prayer Pastor Vladimir Mikita Church Testament of Grace

greet you dear friends, brothers and sisters, with gratitude in my heart I pray for you to the Lord Jesus Christ for financial assistance and your support, for your loving heart to the people of Ukraine and to the Church, which today is under occupation and under pressure from Russian troops, but we are not discourage. Today, there are a lot of people who, with tears in their eyes, are waiting for help in medicines and food, and in prayer for encouragement and inspiration. Thanks to your financial assistance, we were able to help people who were cut off from electricity, water, gas and public transport, without mobile communications. We had the opportunity to refuel volunteers' cars, purchase food products and medicines, and also evacuated people from places of particular danger. And much more. Praise the Lord for your work For the Glory of the Lord.

With the beginning of the war, the life of Ukrainians changed, before and after. Many people were forced to leave their homes and find a safe place for their families. Churches in the western regions of Ukraine have become actively involved in helping refugees. Many thanks to the Samaritan's Bag Charitable Foundation for the funds provided to help people affected by Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Much work has been done during the war with the tangible support of the foundation. The premises of the House of Prayer became a temporary shelter for hundreds of migrants, and shuttle bus trips to hotspots became a way of life. Several bus trips to the East of Ukraine were made. We delivered food and clothes to the residents of the hotspots. On the way back, we took away those who had fled the war. The prayer house's classrooms have become the living quarters of people evacuated from the East. The sisters in the church canteen organized a daily shift in the kitchen and fed the settlers three times a day. The church distributed food kits several times to those who rented accommodation. For the children, the children's ministry team held a celebration with the distribution of Samaritan Bags. Every evening our church prays for peace in Ukraine and an end to the war. We thank the foundation for its important help in such a difficult time. May God bless you abundantly and reward you for your sensitive heart.

Thank you very much for the opportunity you gave us! We were able to buy medicines, food packages, we were able to distribute them in the city and in villages where people did not have the opportunity to buy all this, we were able to help bring people to safe places. They prayed for people, talked about salvation and about the Savior in Nikolaev, Bashtanka, Bereznegovatoe, Krasnogorsk and in the villages of the Nikolaev region. Thank you for your support and prayers, we know and feel the unity of the Church!

There are not enough words of gratitude to those people who supported our Ukraine in such difficult times. We are infinitely grateful to the Samaritan Bag team for this financial assistance, which has sheltered thousands of people and, most importantly, fed them. The "Called to Win" public association has been actively volunteering since the first days of the war. Every day we receive newcomers in various educational institutions of Rivne region, give them temporary shelter, feed and clothe them. And these are thousands of people who come to us every day from the hot spots of Ukraine. You worry about them. And thanks to your help, we were able to put together food packages for families affected by the war. Thanks to your financial help, our volunteers were able to bring these people to us. Therefore, may God continue to abundantly bless your generous hearts and may He return to you a hundredfold all that you will do for our Ukraine. I write, and tears in my eyes, I can not find words of gratitude for you, my dears! I have not stopped thanking you for mentioning you in my prayers. Ephesians 1:16

Dear brothers and sisters, our Church sincerely thanks you for the money you have given us for people who are forced to leave their homes. Thanks to your funds, we have been able to help many families and churches that accept refugees. Many families came to our village, some families from the church took us into their homes, also in our village they took refugees to kindergarten, we bought them everything they needed. We also have elderly people and widows in the Church who could not earn money, we also bought them everything they needed. In the city of Chernivtsi, the church also accepts refugees and we also decided to help them and bought everything they needed, products and hygiene products. Thank you very much, thanks to you we have helped many people. May the Lord bless you abundantly.

First of all, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to Franklin Graham and the entire NLK. You have really been able to show God's love in a tangible way to those who are in difficult situations right now. Our volunteer team has been helping people since the first days of the war, and your contribution has helped us a lot. On the 20th day of the war, a car from our church went on a volunteer trip again. This time it was the city of Kyiv. More than 1000 pieces of fresh bread. At the checkpoint in the city itself, one of the representatives of the territorial defense asks: "Guys, can you buy bread from you?" A conversation ensued about who we are and where we come from. The biggest surprise was when they were given 5 loaves of bread and did not take money for it. They were interested in who we are and why we do it for free, so 2 representatives got in the car and followed us. Arriving at the church while unloading bread, they had the opportunity to communicate and testify to them about God. The boys took contact with the church, have fellowship with local brothers, who continue to tell them about God. Another story… 67-year-old pensioner Anna from Okhtyrka, who was forced to leave the city due to the shelling, came to the church to ask for help. She was prompted by people who were already in the church. Having received a full package of food, necessary medicines and the Gospel, she could not contain her emotions. She was infinitely grateful for her kindness and mercy. A phrase I remembered from her speech: "Your church smells like God… I will definitely come to you for service." Briefly about what the money was spent on: - Evacuation of people from Kyiv region (refueling) - Humanitarian aid (bread baked in our village in the bakery) in Kyiv - Humanitarian aid (food kits, stews, and food prepared in church) for civilians and TerOboron in the liberated towns and villages of Sumy region. - Food aid and medical care for displaced people in our area. - Partially covered the costs and helped one old woman, who is sick, lonely, to buy a used washing machine. - Now we are buying food again and after Easter we are going to help people again. Thank you very much again! We pray every day for you and for our Ukraine. We believe that we will soon continue our ministry in peace!

Hello, my little Church and I see a great miracle of God in your financial help. The fact is that we bought land for the construction of 12 townhouses (95-115 sq.m.) for IDPs because many families have lost their homes and have nowhere to return Thank God we have already managed to do a lot of preparatory work on our own. We have the opportunity to involve migrants in this construction. and God is strong to help in this project. Thank you very much for your generous support. Together we are moving towards victory!

Thanks again for serving the Samaritan Bag for the funds that have already helped feed hundreds of people. The Victory Church has already distributed more than 100 food kits in Nizhyn alone and does not stop there. Victory Church also helps people and churches in other cities of Ukraine. We work and serve God and people further! At the moment there is a very urgent need for a truck for the church to deliver humanitarian aid to Nizhyn !!! Please pray for a solution to this issue. It takes $ 5,000.

We truly thank the partners of the Samaritan Bag for the funds provided. Dear friends, your finances have become especially useful for our church, which serves those who suffered during the war. Thanks to these funds, we have the opportunity to feed the migrants. We have the opportunity to prepare canned meat and send them to hot spots for soldiers and people who find themselves in difficult life circumstances due to hostilities. However, children and the sick are not left out. We organize Christian programs for children. May the Lord bless you abundantly!

Thank God! Dear partners of the Samaritan Bag! We would like to express to you, sincere thanks, that in such a difficult time for our country, you have shown true MERCY! Thank you very much for seeing the need to help us. Funds sent by you Served and still serve for people who were forced to leave their place of residence and were relocated to our area in connection with the war. Due to the fact that we live near the border with Poland, hot lunches, tea and sweets were distributed to people who left our country and stood in line for 2.3 days. Products were purchased for the families who moved and food packages were formed. 35 packages were distributed. And other things necessary for living (electric tiles, beds, blankets, pillows, towels, buckets, utensils) We also decided to distribute food packages to families who lost their jobs due to the war. On the eve of the holidays, food was purchased and distributed to families - migrants, and invited to the holiday services! We believe that this work is not in vain! In the future we will continue to help these people! God bless you !!!

The war came to us suddenly, bringing destruction, pain, tears, and the physical deaths of many civilians. But at the same time, sacrifice, kindness, compassion, and love for the neighbor of many, many Christians, not only in Ukraine, but in the whole world, became abundant with this misfortune. Every good deed requires finances. Our church is very grateful to the Good Samaritan Mission for the significant monetary donation, because thanks to this we were able to form and deliver food packages to people in the occupied territories, refuel trucks carrying humanitarian aid, prepare hot lunches for soldiers guarding strategic sites. , sew bulletproof vests, help refugees in their needs. Thank you very much, dear brothers and sisters from abroad, for not standing aside from our misery, you are truly good Samaritans! Be blessed !!!

Thank God for your material help. We, as the Church, work with displaced people and help them in their needs. They also helped them find housing. In those apartments where there was no connection water, electricity, heating. It was also necessary to make cosmetic repairs in one apartment, because there was a fungus. . We went to the market with them in March, sang to people about God's mercy over Ukraine, prayed with them, handed out gospels and brochures. We also make an English club with them and non-believers come from the city and the district… and we make social packages with food for them. and we also invite immigrants and everyone .. the hall is crowded… and since a lot of people started coming and we started to gather more often in the Church, we used your money to provide some furniture, such as a cupboard so that there was a place to put cups, sugar, coffee, napkins and everything you need .. because very often they drink water or tea or coffee., after all these services we have time to communicate and who wants to drink tea or coffee… so we needed a small hanger where you can put the top clothes, because a lot of children come with immigrants… Our neighbor is also a believer and she has two sons in the army and she lives with her daughter and is very poor… she lost water in the house in the pump and my forehead age Valera, he called a master and hammered a new pipe and connected the water .. This woman's name is Zina. She asked for food and shoes for her sons… Her daughter and she started going to meetings… The other day in Novoselytsia we went to a dormitory where many mothers with children live and who come to our Church, we learned that they do not have an iron, and we went and bought an iron and ironing board .. all these moms were very happy… also for the fact that our room is not very big and we as church members are also not many and we had a problem with chairs we went and bought 12 chairs from us was 50 òàêå This is what we could do and will continue to help with God's help and yours… Thank you for everything. May the Lord help you and bless you… There is still money. And we want to continue to help everyone who needs this help…

Thanks to this financial assistance, we were able to help a large number of people. Here are some stories: 1. There are a lot of soldiers in our community who have had problems with their teeth. Many froze due to bad weather and all the problems became inflammatory. The local dentist treated them for free, but over time she ran out of materials and she asked us to help her in some way or something. Thanks to financial help, we were able to order and pay for dental supplies and the dentist continued to help the boys overcome the pain before they went to the hot spots. 2. We are looking for and delivering rubber aid to migrants and thanks to our help we have the opportunity to buy fuel and continue to help people. 3. After 1.5 months of war, the bus that was constantly carrying aid, people broke down, which stopped all work, because in our time without a car as without hands. And thanks to the funds, we were able to help repair the beads and continue to serve the people. Thank you for supporting and helping us and our citizens in such a difficult and difficult time.

 would like to begin the testimony with a great gratitude to God and the team for the sacrifice and blessing of our local church. During the war with Russia, the Church began to work actively to help the settlers in our area, as well as for defense. In the future, they began to actively help our army and people in the hot spots of our country. In the Zaporozhye region, our church helped buy potatoes for five large families. Many products were purchased and packaged. These kits were distributed to needy people. The church team works with the production of various salads, cookies, cakes for people in the central and eastern regions of our Ukraine. Lunch is delivered every day for the defense of our area. All the settlers who are attached to our church and live in the homes of our brothers and sisters are provided with food and hygiene products. At the moment, our resource is still inexhaustible. We continue to work without stopping. Thank God we can do a great job together.

<p>
Our church is engaged in several areas of service to refugees: providing accommodation for IDPs, as well as providing assistance in the form of food, clothing, hygiene for IDPs. The funds we received gave us the opportunity, first of all, to take care of people living in the homes of our church members as well as in our church building. Most people left in winter clothes almost empty-handed and with small amounts of money in their wallets. That's why we provide people with clothes, shoes and hygiene products. We also take care of their medical needs: visits to doctors, purchase of medicines and payment for prescribed treatment. Everyone can receive food packages, even those who do not live in our church. Also, part of the funds was used to arrange additional accommodation for migrants: beds, mattresses, linen. Given the number of people who pass through our church, all these things require a lot of money. We are sincerely grateful for the help that has opened up many opportunities for our church to serve both Christians and people who do not know God and have encountered Christianity and Christians for the first time.

Our Church is engaged in refugees and settles on the territory of the Church for the night for a decade of days, approximately 300 migrants are accepted per day, three of them are suitable and help to get to know the place of residence for the last term. Deyak³ s³m¿, yak³ zabazali zabazhalis in our m. Chern³vts³ we helped with the rent and the necessary speeches for pobutu - vicorist koshti, yak³ were given to us. Instead, they appointed 3 stati vitrates: transport, dovgotrivale settlement (rent), provision of food and speeches. We also plan to help the settlers themselves. Below is evidence/interview and a photo dekilka, as we took in our families. #1 I want to say a few words about my family and our move to Chernivtsi. My name is Irina, I was born and lived all my life in the city of Dnipro. Like most people, there was an ordinary life, a house, work, the desire to do something for the family. But on February 24, he made adjustments in the lives of many Ukrainians, and my family did not pass by. At first there was a shock, but due to the fact that in our region there were not as many explosions as in other cities, in principle, she continued to work to the sound of sirens. But on March 11, 2022, our family woke up from terrible explosions that were very close (5 minutes drive from our house), the explosion sounded early in the morning, after a couple of minutes another one, then another iiiiii ....... husband Evgeny said to pack things because you have to leave. Having phoned with some friends, the husband was even more convinced of the decision to go, because. one friend was already halfway to Lviv, and the second, David, after the explosions on 03/11/2022 left the Dnieper an hour later. So, the decision was made, the only thing left to do was to convince my mother to go, who is 78 years old and she was not going to go anywhere. As a result, having cried with my mother in turn, our family on 03/12/2022 under the new terrible sounds of rockets flying over our house one after another with the sound of an airplane that lands such an impression on the house, left somewhere ..... On the way to the side West of Ukraine, my husband called David, who left earlier and advised some moments where to stay, where there is gasoline, etc. We stopped to spend the night in the church in Uman, slept right in the prayer house and were grateful to God, we decided where we would go next, because. we planned to rent the most economical housing in Transcarpathia for a couple of months, but David told my husband that his family was staying in Chernivtsi and advised us to go in this direction. Already at night, while staying in Uman, we decided to go to Chernivtsi, David said that they say that for a couple of weeks at most you can live in the church, and during this time we will look for housing and work or go somewhere further. Already on March 13, 2022, we arrived in Chernivtsi in the evening. Today is 04/16/2022! We continue to be in Chernivtsi. The most important summary ...... for all this time, God led our family as He pleases, we never needed anything. No one kicked us out into the street, we were all the time in abundance, warm, not hungry, and every day we were surprised at the people who serve in all this, of course, the pastor and the ministers who organize people. During the period of stay here, several times each of us (mother, me and Milan's daughter) wanted to return to the Dnieper, especially my mother and I, I wanted to work in non-stop mode, and my mother "was sick" garden ", she lives separately from us , in the suburbs of the Dnieper in a private house and of course I wanted to go home.My daughter, in principle, continues to study remotely and endured the move more calmly, and her husband had to maneuver between our emotions and all the time to say that we are not just in this city. because every day I was convinced of this myself.What I want to say is that my mother Maria, a deeply religious person for many years and is a member of the Pentecostal local church, my husband and I were in the Lord, repented and at one time were baptized, but departed from God and the zigzags of life were sometimes on the verge of death and problems, and each time in the understanding that this was not just so, praying and continuing to be far from God, we lived. with every one the same life tossed us even more (I won’t specify, this is a completely different evidence of God’s mercy). Every day I knew for sure that for some reason we are in this city and maybe someone will find it funny or something philosophical or incomprehensible or deep, BUT everything that happens in Ukraine and the life of each of us is more spiritual things than we think. During this time, our daughter Milana repented, her husband Eugene reconciled with God, he also repented, and for some reason this happened in the Bethel Church in Chernivtsi, and not in Dnipro. By the way, a couple of weeks ago I wanted so much to go out and repent, but my legs were chained to the floor. Now I'm waiting and praying for the same prompting to come out to repent. So no matter how scary everything that happens to each of us, all the experiences, fears and dreams of a good future .... for myself, I understand for sure that for me this is a lesson and an opportunity to trust God, because in life I I like to calculate everything in advance and solve all issues, etc., but such a time has come that I feel helpless in many matters and understand that absolutely nothing depends on a person. And now in my head I remember only one thing, when we left the Dnieper, my husband told me: “Don’t worry, God will provide for everything, don’t be nervous about money, housing, food, etc., you will see we will even have an apartment for free ... Of course, I believe God and at that moment I was glad of my husband’s optimism, but inside there were differences of irony and skeptics .... well, today is 04/16/2022, rockets are firing again in the Dnieper, and we live in a quiet blessed city of Chernivtsi, we live for free , before that we lived in two places together with other settlers and were very happy, we do not need absolutely anything, but all because my husband gave the situation to God and prayed that God would lead us Himself. loved ones and relatives for our salvation brought us to this city, even at such a time, but I know that God has plans for our lives, our family is happy that it is here, goes to this church, communicates with believers and in a certain context, this is a blessed time for us, and all my we will understand what, how and why, probably later, but I understood one thing for sure, to be and to seem are different things, i.e. speaking beautifully and listening to what you need to trust God is one thing, but trusting God and trusting is another, and the first steps of faith, trust that my husband took when leaving the Dnieper provided our family with a peaceful sleep and prosperity in everything, and in our area (and not only) in the Dnieper today, windows and doors swayed with a shock wave and caused fear and horror from what was happening. Glory to the Great God!!!!! Peace and goodness to all. #2 Mayzhe p³v m³lyonne place, in yaky zaledve over 100 thousand houses were lost, none on the verge of life and death. Vibratisya z labet hunger and fear is far from cutaneous. How to unblock the place. Our spy, as you know, was spared: in Chernivtsi, the girl opined with all her homeland, for the wine of children and grandmothers. The day before, I was burning - I could not see the fierce 23, with such a heart, for such conditions, I will abandon Mariupol, - guess Yulia Gorbenko. - At the right place, I came from Kiev, I'm delaying, on the eve of this day of the people. My father is a private student, and my mother works with applicants at the Moscow University. Later, 27 fierce mi z tatom went to the volunteer center. On the territory of the abandoned factory, there were a lot of faceless people, sorting speeches, eating and liking, preparing “Bandera smoothies” thinly. Hromadyanskaya ³n³ts³ativa Bula Shalena. Already at that time there was no open pharmacy near the center! We were carrying medicines from our area. People massively bought up preparations for colds and infections, sickness of the heart, calmness. We bought all the "Lidocaine" and "Diclofenac", standing in thin air 40. Gasoline was brought to the volunteer center, so we took up the "Molotov cocktails". They prepared them in a friendly atmosphere, tested the balls and handed over the boxes to the Viysks. Mariupol willingly went to the defense, but there they took less people with combat proof. On the 16th, a year before the commandant's, my father and I broke home. Tilki passed through the part of the war (they used to smoke often), here, behind, they began to vibrate and felt an automaton black. Qi sound like chills on the back, nibi pidganyayuchi you. Ale, they were afraid of me, they could think that they were saboteurs, and shoot me. We sealed our windows with adhesive tape and hung them with kotsiks. With a skin-covered anxiety, they threw themselves at the front doors - they filed a vicon, closer to the center of the booth. There we had a mattress, pillows and carpets. They didn’t go to the bottoms, because our house didn’t have yoga, but they simply couldn’t reach someone else’s. And another birch near the city there was an electrician, a sound, that water was scorched. Gas is the only thing that was lost in us. How to live in chaos My fathers may call the call to buy food in advance, that potatoes and vermicelli would last for a month. We did not starve, although we wanted to clearly fence ourselves. And it washes the family of tourists, so we had fast brewing (for 9 days), gas burners, cylinders, sleeping bags and lanterns. All this saved us, because soon the apartment was +10, and outside -7. In the evenings, we read Mark Twain's Mysterious Island, played Alias, and sometimes sang. These are the only entertainments that somehow strengthened our spirit. Frightened by the lack of bread. We used to bake it in an electric oven, but now we have mastered the oven. It was used to bake pita bread on flour, water and yeast. When the gas later disappeared, bread began to be cooked on vodka and barbecue, wrapped in fiberglass. All the shops were closed, and looters began to break into them. The neighbor brought us chicken legs in exchange for salt. The legs, apparently, have been lying without cooling for a long time, but we ate them with pleasure. And on March 5, I learned that the police had opened the ATB. When I got there, I saw some boxes scattered on the floor, empty shelves, drunks were looking for something. The spectacle is terrible. You see civilization receding and chaos coming. Water was collected from snow and rain, but it ran out quickly. We not only cooked, but also washed, maintained hygiene and washed dishes. One day my father went to Zintseva Balka to the spring. There a shell hit one of the houses, killing two people. Bodies lay in the middle of the road, their bottles lying around, like things from a house. In the mouth of war Around March 4, we heard the sound of a mortar. These are such deaf babbles that you quickly get used to. Usually it all started at 5 am. The shells landed somewhere very close and it seemed that the next one would definitely fly to your room, break the glass, collect all the sheets in a ball of rags and turn the house into a landfill with everyone who lives here. The house shook as if it were an earthquake. And on March 6, we realized what "Hail" is. He comes with such a roar from which he intuitively wants to hide. This roar grows to a superb level, and then falls on your head and ears (we covered them and opened our mouths to avoid contusion). As it turned out, the shells fell in all neighboring yards, except ours. Only our balcony was hit by a fragment. All nearby streets were damaged by metal blows. Somewhere a funnel, somewhere balconies hanging in rags, somewhere black walls from the fire, and somewhere in general demolished the roof, trees fell and broken wires creep along the road. The gas disappeared that day. Enemy bombers flew several times a day. Two bombs were thrown at a time. People almost didn't pay attention to them, as well as to mortars, went out into the yard to lay fires. Our entrance stood by the fire in a group, discussing the news, sharing food. One day our neighbor did not return: he followed the water to the spring and died during the shelling. People began to be buried just in the park across the street. Although another of our neighbors lay at the bus stop for several days, covered with a blanket. There were corpses in other yards as well, some were buried, some were not. It was nervous without news from Ukraine. But my dad connected the generator from the car to our receiver. In the same receiver turned on the wire of the television antenna. So we quickly caught the wave and listened to a telethon every night. Neighbors also came. In addition to our wave, we came across the enemy. I tried to figure out what they were saying, but the language was encrypted. For the next ten days, we lived with one hope. We hoped for a humanist at least. But the number 12 finally made it clear that the Russians were starving us. I was afraid of him even more than hail. My father offered to pack my backpacks and go to my relatives in the village along the sea. However, we did not agree, as the coast could be mined. The way to life We gathered on the road on March 15. They tried to take everyone they could into their van. My mother simply brought her sister's (my aunt's) family under fire. They lived in the basement for the last few days, they came tired, hungry and dirty, although we all haven't washed for a long time. My younger sister was wearing a dressing gown and a jacket. We waited for them in the car near the Drama Theater - this was the last time I saw him whole. Then a girl with a sick child asked us. We left as follows: seven adults and two children. We moved along the corridor: Melekino - Mangush - Tokmak - Zaporozhye. We spent only two days on the road, because the child had oncology and we were allowed out of the emergency. Other people spent the night in queues in the middle of the fields. Most Russians were in Mangush and near Tokmak. They noticed that in Mangush they are a "model of politeness", but the closer to Zaporozhye, the more nervous they are, the stronger they hold the machines, the more blinded by fear and rage. Not far from Zaporizhia we drove past a burning car. And then they learned that an hour earlier the barbarians had fired on the column. Today, my grandparents remain in Mariupol, with whom I have no connection and whom we could not reach. All we have to do is believe in our victory and the lives of those we love!

The funds received became an important resource in helping people affected by the war. The church has two directions in terms of help. The first is caring for refugees who have been forced to flee their homes because of the war. It is difficult to say the exact number of people who have now moved to our town, only those who have passed through our church to three hundred. About 20 families are people whom the church directly helped to find housing and equip everything necessary. Other people who ask for help can get food, clothes, medicine ... In fact, there is no day when people do not turn to the church for help. The second direction is humanitarian aid to people who remained in difficult conditions, near the front line (Kharkiv, Lysychansk). From the first days of the war, we prepare food and send it to people who need it. We are cooking because there is no possibility to cook in those areas. During the war we bought 7 pigs, which were processed into stews and porridge with meat. This is not counting pancakes and dumplings. To date, I'm not even trying to count the number of cans we sent. We help with the evacuation of those who wish to leave. What God does these days often causes tears, and it is the means by which God blesses, because from the first days the church simply gave the last means to serve people in need, and then God began to take care of it. These are people who first crossed the threshold of the church and said, "What can we do?" And then we could serve together, share our experiences, pray. This is a packed hall on Sunday for worship. And the most important thing is the repentance of the people. During this time, 5 people accepted Christ into their hearts. It was unbelievable to hear the words of Vicky from Kharkiv, who was forced to flee the war with her family, leave home, work, but with the rest saying "I'm sorry" to God, then saying "thank you for bringing me back to yourself because of the war" Thank God and thank you for being able to cooperate in the commission that Christ left us.

Many thanks to the sponsors. As early as February 25, people we knew from Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv began to come to us. They received members of the Church at their homes and sought refuge from acquaintances and neighbors. They drove, fed, housed ... On the streets, people were found through people who needed help, they bought and distributed food, bread, things. Sent across the border on various paid and charitable transports. And now we work as a transshipment base.

These funds were used to buy products, provide assistance to people who lost their jobs, and pay for the utility costs of those who lost their jobs. Accessories for military units were also purchased. This work continues. We visit refugees in the villages and in our city. We provide them with food, hygiene products, clothing, and share the gospel.

1. In the first days of the war, our local church did not miss the influx of refugees. At the end of February and the beginning of March, we accepted 3 groups of people from different cities for permanent residence (some of whom were helped to get there by their own transport). Kyiv 10 people, Chernihiv 18 people, Luhansk region 12 people. First, we collected and partially purchased food and hygiene products. 20 people were resettled in the homes of our church members, where they have been living for more than 1.5 months. The rest was settled in apartments in the city of Lutsk, which our brothers and sisters kindly gave for use. Today we use 4 apartments for refugees. In 8 weeks, the Church of the village of Lyshche provides housing, heat, food, hygiene items and basic necessities for more than 40 people. Last week, 10 people helped get to Poland. They were taken to the city of Chelm to the Red Cross because they have hearing and speech impairments. But in their places where they lived with us, we are waiting for new people. 2. Together with the brothers we received from the city of Chernihiv, we decided to immediately collect at least 5 tons of food aid for those who remained in Chernihiv without water and food. A collection of products was announced on the basis of Lyshchenskaya Church. We brought food from the surrounding villages, whose residents were open to help. Patrons were involved, who also donated products. We went to Poland for food and medicine. They brought products from those who wanted to help the churches of our Volyn fraternity. So a miracle happened. Instead of the planned 5 tons, we loaded a truck (truck) of 22 tons! God's mercy! They prayed and sent the truck to Chernihiv, although shots were still heard in some places. 2 days later the truck was at its destination. The local church unloaded, packed and we saw large queues of people who received food kits and water. Products were also distributed at the city's hospitals. 3. In our village there is a Kindergarten where about 50 people live permanently. In the movement stage. Some leave, others come. A member of our church is a social worker in the community, so together with volunteers (also teachers who are in the church) regularly hold classes with children who came with their parents. We use the "Samaritan Bag", read "The Funniest Journey" with them, eat sweets and talk about Christ! 4. In addition, we keep in touch with the military of the Armed Forces. At the request of my friend, they bought and transferred to the "advanced" 1000 meters of telephone cable for communication in the field. Without you, dear friends from the Samaritan Bag Foundation, and without your help, we would not have been able to do so much. Thank you very much for your help and long-term fruitful cooperation! We love and pray for you, with respect, the pastor of the church of the village of Lishche, Alexander Makovsky!

Hello! I would like to thank the Samaritan Bag for the funds provided. They help us a lot. Our church accepts refugees, we have two houses near the church, built for children in 2021, and since the first days of the war we have been accepting IDPs there. In the first two weeks, more than 200 people passed through these houses, stopping for one night and driving on early in the morning. People from Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts also stayed for a longer period of time. then people returned home from these areas when their cities were liberated from the Russian occupiers, while other people settled in their place (Kharkiv, Kramatrosk). about 50 people live in the houses permanently. We covered all utility costs with YOUR help, for church funds (26082 UAH electricity, pump 8000 UAH). We also organized an additional room for housing, ordered 3 beds (UAH 12,000). We also, in cooperation with the regional association of the ECB on the basis of our church, organized a humanitarian aid hub. Our premises are currently under construction (we already dream of completing it) and it now serves as a hub, where products, household chemicals, medicines, clothes in the Cherkasy region and in the church serve people. We also load small cars, buses that go to places closer to the front line, sometimes even beyond the line and carry aid. We try to effectively use the resource provided to us - to meet real needs. The organization and maintenance of this hub also costs money (materials for tables, fuel, sometimes we pay for the delivery of goods by truck and more ... already about 70,000 UAH). We also help the military, military medics, there are military brothers who are at the front. We collect everything we need and give them (mats, sleeping bags, first aid kits, protein bars, ankle boots, etc.). 5 bronzels (UAH 40,000) were purchased for field physicians. We also have your gifts that we give to children and tell about Jesus Christ. With young people from Kharkiv, we are organizing an EVANGELISM SERVICE on the basis of our church after Easter, because we have more than 500 refugees in the village. In this way we proclaim to the world the face of the Church headed by Jesus Christ and become a living sign of God's presence among the people… Thank you very much for your service and support of our work. WE PREACH CHRIST TOGETHER WITH YOU! THANK YOU. There was no place for people at the evening meeting of the church on Thursday, so we ask you to pray and if there is an opportunity to take part in the completion of our church, which is on the "finish" direct construction and it is located in the CENTER of our village. Blessings. I can also download some photos of some checks, and many other photos of our service!

Thank God, dear partners. Today is not an easy time that has forced many to change their usual way of life. And it is today that God has given us the opportunity to work for His glory. Thank God, our church has the opportunity to serve, and thanks to your support, our opportunities have increased, for which we are very grateful to you. May the Lord bless you. We serve by delivering groceries, essentials, social packages and more. While distributing the aid, we meet the gratitude and great surprise of the people of the TPO (temporarily displaced persons). People are surprised that they can get something just like that, useless. By giving help, we have the opportunity to witness and tell of the Lord's mercy, and people who have never served God begin to thank Him. One woman said, "We are very surprised by your kindness and sincerity. we would not help you. But through you we see God. " God has shown these people His love and mercy by using us with you. And for us, God has also shown great mercy to become instruments in His hands. Glory be to Him for this.

Dear Samaritan Bag, we truly thank you for your material help to our church during such difficult times of the war with Russia, for your sacrifice! May God bless you generously. Not only do you pray for us, but you were one of the first to help us financially. The church in the village of Perkivtsi has been actively helping refugees since the beginning of the war, then we received your funds and this made it much easier to work with refugees. Families arrive fast, some stay for a short time, some stay for an unknown period. We use the money for its intended purpose: first of all, the necessary products, clothes and personal hygiene products were purchased. Also, thanks to your funds, beds, mattresses and bedding sets were purchased. Some families needed a washing machine, a washing machine, and a microwave oven. We could have bought it with your donations. We have a pregnant woman who needs treatment, a woman with babies. Some families will need to be transported to the border, so they used the money to buy both fuel and the necessary medicines. We also hold meetings with children in the church, where we talk about God, make handicrafts and distribute delicacies. Thanks to your funds, we are able to bake bread for displaced people not only in our village, but also in the district and region. Thank you again for your help to Ukraine !!! May God bless you abundantly

First of all, we express our sincere gratitude from our Church for the provided funds. At present, our Church has received a total of 32 people from eastern Ukraine. The vast majority of displaced believers who were forced to leave their homes in hot spots. Some of them have nowhere to return (Mariupol). And some have already returned (Kyiv, Irpin). With the provided funds, we hold comprehensive lunches for IDPs, provide funds to families who have accepted IDPs, buy medicine, as some are in serious physical condition. In addition, we use funds for transportation costs for the transportation of food and migrants. We also buy and deliver products and necessary items for the needs of terrorist defense in our area. (However, it is strictly forbidden to take photos there). We also work with children of migrants. As a testimony, I would like to note that very good and friendly relations have been established in our Church with the settlers. During the war we have repentance! Once again, our sincere thanks! Congratulations on the bright holiday of Easter, Christ is Risen !!!

<p>
Peace to you brothers and sisters of the national team "Samaritan's Bag"! The Buzov Church of the ECB is sincerely grateful to you for the financial support of the ministry of our church during the war. From the first day of the war, we became involved in active ministry, helping refugees and the needy in combat. Since the beginning of the war, we have received more than 1,300 refugees in Buzivka, about 300 of whom were deported from Kyiv, Irpen, Gostomel, and Bucha. Every day (except Sunday) we send several cars from Buzivka with help to different cities (Kyiv and region, Chernihiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv region, etc.). The other day I went to the Donetsk region with help. Directly at the Prayer House we organized the collection, processing and production of food (meat stews, pate, porridge. To date, processed more than 150 pigs, made and delivered to the needy more than 20,000 cans of finished products. Also on site at the church there is a help center for refugees. Photos and videos attached. We hope for further cooperation. May the Lord bless you in your ministry!

Thank you very much for your help! There are 18 IDPs living in our house of prayer. Also for 2 months in our house 7 families with children, namely 32 souls found shelter. We helped some of them go abroad and handed them over to volunteers in Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. On the territory of the charity fund where we live, there is a large room where we hold camps for orphans, children with disabilities, Roma children, etc. in the summer. In the last two months, about 150 people have lived in this building, including women, children, pensioners, people with disabilities and large families. With the money you provide, we buy food and feed all our guests, buy the necessary things for everyday life, supplies, stationery, household chemicals, hygiene products and pay for utilities (only utilities cost 30,000 UAH per month) we hold Bible classes for children twice a week, daily prayer meetings and Bible study classes. On April 2, a boy, Bohdan, was born at our base to a young family from Kyiv region. In May, we will have a wedding between young people who met under such difficult circumstances! Thank God, because He is truly Good to us and to His mercy forever !!! We feel it through you and other caring people who are ready to lend a helping hand to our Ukrainians at a difficult time for our country!

From the first days of the war, the Church of the Light of Christ has been accepting refugees from Donetsk, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, and Dnipropetrovsk regions. He does everything he can to help those in need. Receives people, feeds (breakfast, lunch and dinner), provides accommodation, searches and relocates long-term migrants to apartments and houses, forms and distributes food packages and clothing to low-income and refugee families, and sends aid to areas fighting where people are sitting in bomb shelters and basements. Buses carry food to them, and from there take people to the city of Kamianets-Podilskyi. We truly thank you for the funds provided by the mission, for which we were able to buy food and feed the migrants who live directly in the House of Prayer "Light of Christ", those who are taken out of the occupied territory by our buses. We meet them, feed them, witness to them about Jesus Christ and relocate them, forge food kits and distribute them to low-income and large families, and send aid to the war zone, where people sit in bomb shelters and basements. Also send food and other necessities to towns and villages that have already been liberated from the occupiers to help them. We truly thank all those involved in this charitable work. May the Lord reward you with His graces and bounties, and may His grace and blessings be multiplied to you and your family! May His protection and peace be with you. "May the Lord bless you, and may He keep you safe!" May the Lord shine upon you with his face, and may he have mercy on you. May the Lord turn his face on you, and may he give you peace! ” (Numbers 6: 24-26)

Khmelnytsky region Work with refugees in our region is in the following areas: 1. providing short-term and long-term asylum on the territory of houses of prayer and in apartments / houses of believers; 2. assistance in bringing refugees to the border for further travel abroad; 3. receiving / distributing humanitarian aid; 4. search for producers of finished products and purchase of food from them; 5. formation of food kits and their distribution to refugees; 6. organization of assistance to hot spots of Ukraine; 7. non-military assistance to the armed forces (mainly medical supplies and food); 8. providing refugees with spiritual assistance, invitations to worship, etc. Almost all churches in the region are involved in working with refugees, but 21 churches are more active. These are usually the city's churches with the largest number of refugees. Some of them provide places for long-term residence on the territory of houses of prayer, others - in the homes of believers: In the first stage of the war, refugees mostly went to the western regions and abroad. Our churches provided them with places for temporary shelter - for 1-2 days. During this time we received more than 8,000 people (7997 on 18.04.22). But later, people began to come looking for places to live for a long time. Such people usually had no food or clothing. We bring and distribute humanitarian clothing and form food kits. We try to buy products from local manufacturers and wholesale warehouses in our cities. To do this, we collect applications from churches and create a database to then make a wholesale purchase of products. We rent a bus from one of the entrepreneurs, which we use to help around the region. In the future, assistance with clothing and food will become increasingly important for migrants. Some churches have begun building small one-room buildings that will house refugees. We are looking for funds to complete the construction of a building in the village of Korystova, which can accommodate elderly people for a long time. We truly thank you for your help in such a difficult time for our country! Thanks to this, we can help those who are in great need. May God bless you and expand our cooperation with you!

We settled in our two refugee rehabilitation centers during the war, and refugees live in the homes of church members. We have refugees from Odessa, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Popasna, and Melitopol. Some have gone abroad, but most still live here. We are infinitely grateful for the help, we help people with food, basic necessities (diapers, baby food, hygiene items, etc.) and also pay for electricity, firewood, etc. We also have the opportunity to preach the gospel and pray for the Jews

(About 800 people were deported to the border in 50 days of war)

Congratulations dear friends! At this difficult time for our people, for our country, our local Church has become exactly the island of security that people so desperately need. And especially those fleeing the hot spots of Kharkov, Mariupol, Kiev, Irpin, Bucha and many more! Hundreds of migrants had the opportunity to get a place to sleep, relax, eat, wash things, get medicine, clothes and take certain food kits on their way! Thanks to our sponsors we were able to buy a washing machine for our Church, it is such a necessary thing for refugees who are not one day on the road, and who are still on their way! We have fed and continue to feed hundreds of people with hot and delicious dinners that come to the door of the House of Prayer! We helped to refuel our refugees, as well as for our volunteers who worked for the Church and addressed many refugee issues. We have harvested many stacks of firewood to keep our Church warm and comfortable. We had the opportunity to provide shoes and clothes for families who came to the door of our Church with one small bag or just a package of documents (just all they managed to take, because most of them gathered in a hurry and under fire). We are sincerely grateful to our partners who so worried about us! Which share our pain, and help! Thank God for you! We are constantly in prayer for our friends. Thanks to these finances, our Church has not only been able to become a refuge for refugees, but has also been able to help us solve the hundreds of issues we had! Our House of Prayer was full of people, and we see in this a great blessing, and the Hand of God. Because it is at this time that people are especially in search of the Lord and the truth! We truly thank everyone whose heart is open to Ukraine. With love, gratitude and prayers, your friends from the Uman House of Prayer.

Congratulations, since the beginning of the war our church has been serving refugees and to date we have received 3,078 people. To do this, we bought mattresses and bedding to equip our Sunday school classes for the night, and we feed three times a day people who live in our church. We bought freezers and plan to buy a large refrigerator. We also used the funds to pay for utilities in March. Over the past month, we have helped food packages to refugee families and families who have lost more than 350 packages. We also used the funds received from you to help refuel cars for refugees in need. At the moment, we are constantly helping financially and with food packages to 5 families who have moved and live in our city.

<p>
Dear brothers and sisters, peace be upon you! Welcome to the Church "Bethel" in Vinnytsia. We are grateful to our Lord that we have seen the light of a new day. Because of the circumstances in our Ukraine, God teaches us to appreciate every day and time of the day. God teaches us to leave our homes, hug and kiss our wives, husbands, children, and come home to rejoice that all are alive and well. We have a terrible war going on in Ukraine, we feel it with our hearts, souls and lives, but with our minds, we still can't understand everything and believe in it. A war where modern weapons are used - from which it is almost impossible to hide. Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Irpin, Bucha, Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, and Zhytomyr are bombing residential neighborhoods. There are a lot of migrants, people are leaving these cities en masse. Our house of prayer is located on the main street of the city and we receive many people who go further to western Ukraine, abroad or are looking for housing in Vinnytsia. We stay from 150 to 250 people a day. Our mission is to receive people, provide them with food and a place to rest. Sometimes some have nowhere to go, but stay for two or three days in church. Our sisters are on duty in the kitchen around the clock, cooking and baking bread themselves, because it is very expensive to buy so many people every day. Every day 6-8 brothers are on duty day and night, receiving people. We also try our best to provide temporarily displaced persons with everything they need (medicines, personal hygiene items, clothes, etc.). Due to weather conditions (cold spring), the church's heating season was not suspended. After all, immigrants are in church every day. Because of this, most of the money is allocated for utilities. Dear brothers and sisters, We have received $ 5 (five) thousand in financial assistance from you through the Samaritan Bag Mission. The funds have been used to provide for all those affected by the war. The church is engaged in the removal of affected women, children, the elderly, the organization of food and settlement of refugees with their subsequent arrangement. We truly thank you for participating in this ministry as well. May the Lord bless you all abundantly, for your sacrifice, strengthen your strength and give you back a hundredfold. May the Lord bless you and your families! Sincerely, Pastor of the Church Anatoliy Martyniuk.

We are sincerely grateful to the Lord for the money we received from the Samaritan Bag. This is a huge support to families who help refugees in this difficult time…. These funds were able to help families in the local church who took in refugees to compensate for the costs of utilities and food…. They were also able to help a pastor who has been delivering humanitarian aid to his church in the Kyiv region several times…

We are the Muratov family, immigrants from the village of PILIPOVICHI, which is near Borodyanka, Kyiv region. At the moment of evacuation from the place of hostilities, the question arose where? And the Lord, through the brothers in Christ, gave us the contacts of Pastor Negro Valentin Berezovsky of the ECB Church. Gratitude to the church and to each individual for giving us shelter, providing us with everything we need, moreover, they gave us a place to live, where we still live. From the first days of our location, we feel ourselves in God's family, protected, thanks to pastor Valentine for his service to God. After all, the House of Prayer serves every day not only for the Believers, it feeds the city (APU, territorial defense, kindergartens, ordinary people who need it). Hot, full meals. I thank you that the full potential of material assistance from volunteers, the charitable foundation is used for its intended purpose with love for others. Praise the Lord God Jesus Christ for mercy and grace.

<p>
At the beginning, I would like to sincerely thank you for the funds received, which brought great blessings and real help and support to those people who suffered as a result of the war with Russia. Our territory was originally a transshipment base, a place to spend the night for those people who went to Western Ukraine, who needed to spend the night, eat and wash, which we constantly did and continue to do. About 600 people could take advantage of this opportunity. We also helped evacuate people from dangerous areas in Chernivtsi from Bucha, Irpin, Sumy and the region, a total of about 150 people. Today we deal with those internally displaced persons who have remained in our territory and very often come to them and need basic things: pots, pans, electric stoves, electric kettles, bowls, mugs, spoons, mattresses, bedding, pillows, blanket not to mention food. They have a special need for communication, emotional and spiritual support, and we provide them whenever possible. I want to tell a little experience. Mykola Gololobov's family came to us from Mariupol, with his wife Tatiana, daughter Ulyana and mother Vertylo Ina Oleksandrivna. This family lived in Donetsk before the war. In 2014, due to the war, they were forced to leave their acquired property and move to Mariupol. But on February 24 this year, they had to become refugees for the second time. All the property they bought in 8 years was lost again. Hiding from the explosions, they spent three weeks in the basement of the house. But when their stay in the city became completely impossible, they broke through the encirclement of the enemy in their own vehicles, without green corridors, under bullets and explosions, with prayers to God, and left for the city of Dnipro. Unfortunately, it was not safe to stay there and they decided to go to Cherkasy. We provided assistance for this family in the form of funds, utility bills, clothing and food. May the Good Lord bless you abundantly for your care and help.

Our local church has the opportunity to help dormitory kitchens and other institutions that feed refugee people. Therefore, they used financial aid for food, as well as purchased fuel for trucks to send aid to hot spots in Ukraine. There were testimonies of one man who got on the evacuation bus: He did not know who the believers were, he thought that they were being taken to the organs. But when he found himself at the refugee reception site, he noticed in two or three days that the believers were friendly and kind people, which he himself told us about. This boy is an orphan, he has no relatives, so his desire to stay in Rivne, because his house in Irpin was destroyed. His first words about God were, "I don't believe He exists." But after a week of observing and communicating with believers, he began to read the Bible and testified that he already knew who Jesus was, because he had read it and understood it. This is the way the Lord speaks to man. This is our joint work. Hundreds of people fed your finances, paid for the delivery of tens of tons of fuel, dressed dozens of people who were left without clothes. Even we had and still have the opportunity to help the military. More than 100 pillows and dozens of sleeping sets were sewn. May God bless you very, very abundantly, and everything will be fine in your life!

Thank you for your help, we were able to support people and provide the necessary for living in this difficult time, these are migrants from Bucha, Irpin, where they were left with nothing due to the fact that the enemy destroyed everything in its path. But they were able to get out and settle in a safe place, and we supported them in every way we could to start a new life by knowing Jesus as our personal Savior, by giving us New Testaments and gifts. And we have settled in the Church and on the basis of up to 100 people who from Kharkov, Mariupol, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kramatorsk support and provide everything necessary for living. Bless you for your help. Thank you.

Thank you very much for your financial help. With these finances, we collected children and people in our village who were internally displaced, and there are more than 160 people and 34 children in our village. Used finances to help with the delivery of aid: food, clothing to Kyiv and Chernihiv regions; took people to Makariv. We buy medicines for people who are internally displaced and do not have the opportunity to buy these drugs themselves. 40 km from our village there is a village Sosnove there in the dormitory live internally mixed people, mostly women with children and the elderly whom we help with hygiene and medicines. There are also many more needs for medicines and food, we pray and continue to plan and want to take help to Chernihiv and Poltava regions. Next we help the internally displaced in our area. We have a great desire to build a room in the neighboring village to be able to gather with people and children to study God's Word about this work, we pray and if God encourages you to support this work, we will be very grateful !!! Thank you for God's grace to fill your needs and desires! It is more a request to pray constantly for peace and liberation of Ukraine from occupation.

Dear brothers and sisters, we thank you for your sacrifice and practical participation in the ministry through our church for the regions that suffered during the military aggression. The finances are used to cover expenses and work directly in the Chernihiv region, which the Church of the ECB "Salvation" has taken care of: food packaging, purchase of medicines, electricity supply on the basis of the church in Chernihiv to meet the needs of residents. In addition, residents of other regions of Ukraine are constantly transported and received in the temporary center in Rivne: settlements, food, transportation to the border with Poland. Therefore, financial assistance is extremely urgent, necessary and important. Thank you for your relevance and timeliness, your brothers and sisters in the evangelical faith.

Thanks to the funds we received from the Samaritan's Bag, we were able to help many people who were forcibly displaced in our region who were fleeing the war from eastern Ukraine. For example, outside the city there is a school where many families with children live, we provide them with food and necessary medicines purchased with help. In addition to this school, we are helping another school located in the city, where immigrants also live. In these schools we hold entertainment events for displaced children (games, motorbikes, cotton candy, trampoline, etc.). We also buy food and other necessities for families who have taken refuge with refugees.

1. We thank the "Christmas Child" project of Ukraine for the help and opportunities you provide us to serve in this difficult time for Ukraine. There are now many refugees we have the opportunity to serve. Artem, Maria and two children from Mariupol were temporarily with us. They had nothing left in connection with the war except a car that they were able to escape from the shelling in Mariupol. They were given clothes, shoes, food and fuel for the car to get to western Ukraine. Sincere words of gratitude to God for the help they so desperately needed. 2. Widow, pensioner, Dragalyuk Olena, Pomichna. Her son Ruslan is now at the front in the hottest spot of hostilities, defending Ukraine. We always pray for him and God protects him and other soldiers. From the church we visited her and handed over the food set, which she accepted with tears of gratitude to God and to you. Thank you for the opportunity to serve such needy people. God bless you!

We used the proceeds from the mission to support refugees from the war zone. Our Church has 35 people in full support - we provide them with food, medicine, pay for utilities. One family lives in a Sunday school. We also provided one-time assistance (food) to all refugees who are in the territory of our united territorial community. This is more than 40 families.

Our church has been working for several years to build a house of charity for the elderly, but in connection with the war, our house sheltered refugees from hot spots in Ukraine, where hostilities are taking place. Currently, there are 45 migrants with children from Kramatorsk, Slavyansk, Kharkiv and Donbass. We provide them with 3 meals a day, provide all the conditions for living. We also have visitors for a few days, who go on. Here they can eat as well as spend the night. We are sincerely grateful to Samaritan's Bags for such tangible financial assistance. May the Lord bless you.

<p>
Thank God, dear brothers and sisters! We truly thank God for you and your work and help for the Ukrainian people in this difficult time for our state - Ukraine. On behalf of our church in the village of Malovody, I sincerely thank you for providing us with financial assistance in the amount of $ 5,000. These funds were a great blessing for those people who suffered from the terrible Russian military aggression ... With these funds, we have repeatedly purchased food and other necessary assistance and through our regional volunteer brothers transferred to these cities, where hostilities are now taking place . We also set up a house near our House of Prayer, which housed 4 families (12 people) together with small children, whom we fully provided with everything we needed. Several more families were admitted to the premises of the former school, water supply was restored for them, a washing machine was bought, a boiler was installed, bedding and other things were bought. They were also provided with food and medicine. More relatives come to them, and thanks to you, we can accept and help them. We believe that the help given to them saves not only their lives, but also their souls, because we pray for them that the Lord will grant them salvation !!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!! MAY GOD BLESS YOU !!! PRAY FOR YOU !! ??????

Thank you very much for the money. At the beginning of the war, the church received 30 immigrants and people in transit (overnight only). We provided all the necessary assistance. At present, our church is inhabited by immigrants. We provide them with food, clothing, water, hygiene products, medicines, diapers for children, detergents for dishes and floors. We pay for utilities. We buy food and make food kits and distribute to those who need it. We buy fuel for travel to meet different needs. We spend time with children (drawing, lessons, children's entertainment). For one family of migrants we help to buy a house and arrange everything in the house, bought utensils (pots, bowls, spoons, mugs) and various means of living. We bake bread, make dumplings and send to cities where there is no food.

Our parish has 25 villages. Almost everyone has immigrants that we try to meet. Therefore, there are high transport costs. In the courtyard of our church there is a four-storey house that can accommodate more than 40 people. It is equipped with a prayer hall, a conference hall, a game room ... We try to provide people with everything they need, especially conversation, compassion, love. Your money goes to: fuel, car parts, home heating, electricity, water products, hygiene products, clothing, tools for creative activities (stationery, toys, games, movies) Thank you very much for your financial support! May God bless you all! Peace be upon us all! With prayer Vladimir.

Thanks to the Samaritan's Bag, which helped our churches (Kukhitskaya Volya and Kukhche), we were able to help people who suffered from the war and people who directly survived the war. We made food packages for the victims of the war, and also bought bread. We filled the packages with the most necessary products and things that people need in the first place. The funds were also used for the transportation of potatoes for internally displaced persons, as well as for the delivery of bread, pastries and food packages in the area affected by the war. People gratefully accepted the help, because they don't even have anything to eat. Thank God for you, because without your help we would not be able to do what has already been done. Thank you for supporting with money at such a difficult time. May God bless and protect you!

Thank God !!! Thank you that God himself sent you to us !!! We helped the refugees but all at our own expense and here the Lord has blessed us with you !!! With your help, we have expanded our ministry to displaced people. To date, we have taken the night and fed and sent almost 300 people. We have a small church of 35 members, but we have done and are doing a really great job. Every day our sisters at the House of Prayer bake cookies to the east, make dumplings, cook stews. In the upper hall where the service takes place, we distribute clothes for the displaced. And at night we accept people who go further west. Thanks to you, we have the means to feed these people and buy products for these products. You have no idea what a blessing it is for you and how much work can be done if you have the means and desire to work. Refugees and people from our town began to come to our church to serve, because seeing what work is being done, people are surprised and say that we and the true Church of Christ are truly destined to help others. Thank the Lord for you !!! May God give you 100 times more !!!

We did not think that such a reality would affect us, but one day we woke up with the news of the war… Then the aggressive policy of Russia, broken cities and villages, disadvantaged and despised residents - and a large number of migrants. This is the reality of today in our country! The sound of sirens and uncertainty about the future are the characteristics of many Ukrainians. For our part, we continue to serve in the village of Kadubivtsi. At this time, God is teaching us greater compassion and humility toward those who are called "newcomers" in Scripture. During this period, we accepted 30 families - some of them stayed, and some have already left in their direction. It was difficult to watch the families who took in, because it is food and hygiene, and their own space. The funds we received are timely support for both IDPs and host families. After all, here and: utilities, food, medicines and personal hygiene products, travel expenses. Also in our area allocated for migrants and a local kindergarten, which housed 20 families. Of course, they were given a roof over their heads, and they have to provide for themselves personally. We, from the local church, decided to support them… It was a timely "generous gift" from you, because these children, men and women were able to get help. We had the opportunity to see how people value what they already have or can get now. Volodya and Yulia's family is raising two boys, they lived in Chernihiv. Julia worked as a saleswoman in a store, and Volodya worked part-time on a construction site. When the war broke out, they hurriedly gathered everything they needed in two suitcases, looking for a safer place. Our sister Olga heard about the needs of the IDPs and decided to shelter them, where 8 people from the occupied territories already lived. Time passed and it was very difficult, we, for our part, tried to financially support this home, we saw all the migrants at our meetings. At the moment, they have nothing to return to, the store was bombed, as it is not clear with housing, and it is extremely scary to return. The second family is Sasha and Marina with their daughter. They are from Kharkiv. At one time they were well-off people: their apartment, work in the energy sector, their favorite city. They could not escape in time, but volunteers helped. We traveled for a very long time, because the curfew is in effect and we are also left with nothing… Thank you for your compassion and understanding in support of this difficult time.

Our church is sincerely grateful for the money received by the Samaritan Bag. In fact, a very difficult time! We appreciate that the whole world is with us and helps as much as it can. We received many immigrants and tried to show everyone, first of all: the Christian life - and we saw that more people do not know God and his son Jesus Christ! But, thank God, many people came closer and believed in our Creator. Thanks to the help you have given us, we have been able to provide food, hygiene products and medicines to more than 100 people. Many people did not know God and first heard of our Savior Jesus Christ. Some of them began to attend our services. It is very important to support people, especially those who have lost everything. For example, one family from our church received refugees from Kyiv who moved there from Luhansk in 2014! So they lost everything - a 47-year-old woman came in what she was wearing in a bomb shelter, and that's all she has. Another family lost their house and all their property, but this will not be equal to the loss of the lives of loved ones, we have some. Also, our church joined the collection of humanitarian aid for the military from our village and provided food, it is very difficult for them, as they are now at the forefront! May God bless you and save your families! We thank you very much and glorify our Jesus Christ for you - the Samaritan Bag.

On behalf of the whole church, I would like to sincerely thank the Bag Samaritan Mission for your sacrificial service to internally displaced persons. Our church serves these people, prepares food kits, buys essentials, arranges housing for migrants, helps with clothes. Today we have more than one hundred and sixty people, so in order to accommodate everyone we rent housing for many, because many of them do not have basic hygiene items at all, and there is no question of finances. Therefore, the funds we have received from the mission are a great blessing for these people and for our church, because for us it is also a good auxiliary tool in the work of the gospel. Today, as I write this letter, I do so with joy, because an hour ago I witnessed man's conversion to God through the social affliction of the church, and this is not an isolated case. The Samaritan Bag mission also has a great destiny in this matter. We use these funds to buy food, and to buy mattresses for the beds, there are also those to which we give money, because they were left with nothing. Among these people are twelve infants for whom we buy diapers and baby food. May our Lord bless you abundantly, we sincerely thank all the brothers and sisters who sacrificially serve us Ukrainians. And may the Lord of peace himself always give you peace in every way. The Lord be with you all! 2 Thessalonians 3:16

We want to share with you how the Lord works in people's lives, through your sacrificial hearts. As we transport people from ruined cities, we hear about many different situations that force people to leave their homes. And in some moments we take part. One of which we want to tell you. One day a woman called our pastor Roman and said that she had learned from her friend that it was possible to get to the border for free. The pastor replied that of course we would help. When we met her, we learned that her name is Elena, she has two small children, she is an orphan, because of the danger in her city she is forced to leave her home and flee to safety. Once a child, every summer a family from Germany invited her to their home, and they became a family she had never had. And so Elena decided to go to them. From the beginning, she planned to go to Poland, stay there for a few months and find volunteers to help her cross the border with Germany. Elena was in despair, because she went to a country where no one knows. The Lord already had a plan for her. We brought her to the city of Rivne and the blessing began. Through many phone calls, we found a family in Poland who was ready to shelter them with their children indefinitely. On the same day, we learned that a man was traveling to Ukraine from Poland, who also transported people only abroad. Contacting him, it turned out that he was going to the city where Elena was already waiting. The next day she called from Germany, her joy knew no bounds. She was surprised that in such a short time so many people were involved in her need. Elena thanked us and everyone who responded, but we replied that the Lord had done all this for her, and we were just an instrument in His hands. We are currently in touch with her. Thank God that He is our loving Father and Elena felt it too. Another story of how God works now at such a difficult time. One young family, consisting of two parents and seven children, was leaving Sumy with their friends. Only God saved them. On the way their car breaks down, a car full of children is cold in the yard. They called us and asked us to pick up this family just on the road, because the car is no longer working. We picked them up and took their family to the corodon the next day. Thank God for being able to serve others.

<p>
Congratulations! We are to Ukraine! We want to thank God and you for your significant financial support to our Church during this difficult time of war with Russia. Virtually all members of the Church help those who can. Thanks to the established relations with the Churches in Romania, it is possible to receive humanitarian aid, which we bring ourselves. And in the opposite direction, refugees are transported abroad. A lot of fuel costs. The aid is distributed primarily to migrants and transit refugees who travel further west. We sent a car with food and clothes, diapers to Chernihiv, Kremenchug, villages of Cherkasy region Lisove, Yasnozir'ya, other villages where I am displaced, we bring food kits for families of migrants in Cherkasy, Smila, small church groups and services in Cherkasy, where there are migrants and just needy people. Of course, we also help in our Church those who have not gone abroad and need clothes and food. Help is also for those we see around us, locals, who are also important to many now. Many are out of work. We partially buy on our own, food, hygiene items, different packaging and packaging. We did not forget about the animal shelter, a batch of old clothes was sent there, which was collected in the process and it is no longer suitable for people. Importantly, many migrants had to be accepted for temporary and permanent residence. It took time, opportunities, housing, and many different needs for the displaced. Dear brothers and sisters! We truly thank you for your generous help at this time! And may God bless you with His blessing in everything, in life, in service, for His glory!

<p>
Grace Church in Tysmenytsya became a local haven for many refugees from eastern and central regions of Ukraine who were forced to leave their homes fleeing the war zone.  Over one hundred refugees from Kharkiv, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Bucha, Kyiv have found shelter here for a couple of days on their journey west. About 45 adults and children are permanently living on the premises at present.  Our church is located in the former shopping mall - the shops here became bedrooms for the refugees while the exhibition hall - a cafeteria.  We are very grateful for all your donations that help us to buy all the necessities, including food, clothing, personal hygiene items, washing detergents, as well as to pay for all the utilities (electricity, water, sewer). Your support also helped to purchase a washer and a dryer, and a fridge with a freezer.  May God’s blessing continue to be upon you!

For our ministry, these funds have become a supernatural blessing from Christ through you !!! A large number of migrants from the occupied cities and even those who were left without homes, clothes and even food were able to get the necessary things for the first time living in our area! We were able to provide repeated help to the needy along with this, we had the opportunity to testify of the Savior of their souls. Mentally wounded people take the Word of God into their hearts and seek healing! Prayers and material help are our vocation to bring the Good News to all, especially to war victims. Thanks to your donation, we have the opportunity not only to share the Gospel, but also to become friends with our immigrants, to invite them to worship and to keep in touch for further cooperation! With Love, the missionary team and the Church of Christ v. Ivanivka, Ternopil region. Ukraine.

Thanks to financial support from the Samaritan Bag, our church has been able to work hard for immigrants and people suffering from war. The house of prayer was equipped with everything necessary for the reception of migrants who stay for a short time and for those who live for a long time. Many food, personal hygiene items and many other necessities were purchased. Thanks to such work, the people who received help began to attend services regularly. About a thousand people passed through the shelter of the church, several families remained for permanent residence. Now we continue to work intensively with migrants, every day people come for food, clothes, basic necessities. The great evidence is that unbelievers come to help the church when they see that we do many good deeds for people. Therefore, sincere thanks from all of us for such good support and help! May the Lord bless you abundantly !!! With love and prayers for you, the Church of Jesus Christ!

Unfortunately, we did not receive the funds in full. $ 980 was held, but we are also grateful for the funds provided. This is a great help during this difficult time. From the first days of the war, our church has been actively helping the residents of our city of Sumy and the region. Shelter was provided to people in the basement of our church (about 100 people). On March 3, people began to be evacuated to Poltava, and humanitarian aid was brought from Poltava and distributed to those who needed our help. and necessary things. When we arrived in the village near Trostyanets, people told us how difficult it was for them to grind wheat with a hand-held coffee grinder and bake cakes on the water, and when we gave them food kits, they cried and hugged. It was very touching.

The funds helped us in three areas: 1. cooking for the victims of Russian aggression in eastern and southern Ukraine. In particular, the cities: Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Sumy and Kyiv region. We buy food for food and prepare canned food, bake bakery products, dumplings, pilimeni, etc., and transport it to the place of need in evangelical churches where the brothers distribute to the victims. 2. From the beginning of the war until today, we accept 20 refugees (pictured) in our local churches. Every day we prepare lunches for them and provide them with basic necessities. 3. We provide refugees with housing as much as possible for 10-15 people

We truly thank the Samak Samaritan Mission for helping our church in these difficult times for Ukraine. Upon receipt of the funds, we were able to serve as food and medicine for refugees who fled the war zone. Our church members have received and still receive people from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Pologi. Some of them have nowhere to return because their homes have been destroyed. We plan to help them find and buy some housing from us. Also, with these funds, we were able to help needy families and children with disabilities, whom we still served financially. Another area of service is supporting our soldiers on the front lines. we had the opportunity to organize two trips to the front line when it was difficult with food and medicine. May the Lord abundantly bless and reward every donor who has contributed to this good cause, and especially may He bless the mission of the Samaritan Bag and its President Franklin Graham for the fraternal support of the Ukrainian people in these terrible days.

We thank the Lord and the fund, "Samaritan's Bag" for the funds in the amount of 5000 «, which we received for the work of the Yakymovets Church with people who are on the territory of Lanovets OTG due to military actions. The funds were used: For the overhaul of the car of people who came from Kharkiv and temporarily live here. For people who live and lived with members of the local church (many people rested and went further west). We also visit people who are temporarily living in our area (we buy grocery kits, donate Gospels and other Christian literature, and invite them to our church). May the Lord bless you abundantly!

Welcome. This help has greatly helped us to serve the church and serve the people of the city. We were able to pay for the trucks to bring help. We bought firewood to heat the house of prayer, which is also not cheap, but thanks to the help we were able to. These funds help us to serve migrants, to serve refugees who have lost their homes. They also held an Easter holiday for the children of migrants. Thank you for your dedication.

<p>
From the first days of the war, our church opened the doors of our institutions and local communities to shelter internally displaced persons. In the first days of aggression, all people were as sacrificial as possible and brought everything they needed - food, blankets, warm clothes and even money to support our guests, but over time, people's opportunities became smaller and we had a logical question and for what resources we we have to keep a thousand people we sheltered. We are sincerely convinced that the service of the Samaritan Bag is God's answer and not just an answer but a real support during this difficult period for the church and for the whole of Ukraine. Most of the people we sheltered were at our Solomon Christian School, which has been a hub for 2,000 people since the beginning of the war. We also used our sanatorium "Bukovynska Chereshenka" where now live 150 people who have nowhere to go. The Christian sports and improving camp "Your Camp" also didn't stay aside and today about three hundred people live there, one hundred and forty of which children from boarding schools of the Nikolaev area. The road of these children to us was very dangerous and some educators were killed. We do not know how much more time these children will spend in our camp, but our church feels a great responsibility for them and tries to meet not only their physical needs but also their spiritual ones. Thank God that there are people who share Bible truths with them every day. People from many churches in the Chernivtsi region have shown their love for these children. Many thanks to God for the Samaritan Bag!

The House of Remembrance Church is grateful for the financial assistance provided by the Samaritan Bag. With this money it was possible to evacuate about 250 people from the Donetsk region to Western Ukraine. These are mothers with children, large families, and the elderly. People are very grateful for the opportunity to go to a dangerous place. Food aid was also provided for those who remained in Druzhkivka. The bus evacuating people was repaired. At the moment, food aid is being delivered to settlements that were previously under the occupation of Sumy and Mykolayiv regions.

Our church received up to 100 refugees a day on peak days. There were 3 main waves of refugees. Volunteers of our church met them, organized a visit, brought food, mattresses, beds and household items. A team of senior officials decided to direct all donations from people donated after utilities and other mandatory payments to support refugees, feed them, and help them find permanent housing. We now organize weekly meetings for refugees in our city on Saturdays to preach the gospel, distribute food kits, and serve them to children. We also provide free legal assistance and haircuts. Before Easter, we formed 200 food kits for migrants who live near our church.

When we started accepting refugees, a woman from Mariupol came to us two days after giving birth, she didn't even wash her baby, thanks to finances we were able to provide diapers, food, a stroller and so on. She said she did not know where she was going and what would happen to them, but God cared! When our young men bring aid to cities where active hostilities are taking place and where civilians remain, they sincerely thank you for half a loaf of bread this week! They brought a woman from Kharkiv who had an operation and three days later she had to leave the hospital because she was bombed, we were bandaged, provided with the necessary medicines. There are many stories of people who come or live in cities. Thanks to your financial help we can take care about the people who suffered in this war! We truly thank God and you !!!

Our area, unfortunately, from February 28 until today, under occupation. The ministry of our brothers and sisters is thousands of compatriots evacuated from the occupation, constant delivery of food, medicine and everything necessary to the occupied territory. Accommodation of evacuees on the territory of Ukraine and abroad. Those brothers and sisters who remained in the occupation constantly visit all the houses in Snihurivka and the surrounding villages. They feed people, find those with whom they have lost contact, etc. For example: recently, evacuated from the village. Tamarino (our partner in the bag of the Samaritan) to Moldova, a mother and three daughters, whom she hid from the invaders by cutting "under the boy". According to her, there are half of the villages of raped women. And for the few days they were with us, my mother cried all the time. Thanks to your help, we have money for fuel, transport repairs, purchase of necessary (which we can not find from other sources). Thank you very much! May the Lord bless you!

Thank you for your cooperation! Your help, with hammers and material means, inspires us to work, among children and adults, to help our neighbors. As a church, we were able to gather more than 130 people from two villages for the Easter holiday. We resettle refugees in their places of residence, helping them with food and basic necessities. Every Sunday, those who are willing to listen to the word of God use the transport to attend services. We are preparing a program of summer camps for school-age children for 300 people. May the Lord strengthen you for His glory in the work of His field. Congratulations to Pastor Ivan Kens.

Thank God for the funds provided, thanks to them we were able to receive 535 people in the house of prayer, during the whole war, currently 17 people live. For these people we were able to equip a shower, buy mattresses, utensils, basic necessities such as children's items, clothes for different ages, food for a permanent stay in the House of Prayer and to create food kits that were distributed and given to all who drove further west. The rent of buses was also paid in order to be able to transport both people and necessary things. All who have moved from the regions where the fighting is taking place are taking part in and glorifying the Savior. We are grateful for such support.

<p>
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the "Cry of the Child's Soul" NGO has been actively organizing with the help of the Armed Forces. The funds received from the "Samaritan's Bag" were a great miracle, an extraordinary blessing and support for us and an encouragement to the fighting spirit of our defenders. With the funds received, our organization was able to purchase ammunition, various medicines, including painkillers and hemostatics, and significant amounts of food. Thanks to the "Samaritan's Bag" we managed to help the 14th military brigade, which is located on the front line in Kherson. Assistance was also sent to 44 military brigades from the Ternopil region. The special unit that is currently guarding us in Izyum was not left without help. Our organization and the defenders of Ukraine are infinitely grateful to God and the Samaritan Bag for their great support. "A hungry soldier is not a soldier," said one of our defenders. So with new strength and faith in victory, boys and girls are infinitely grateful for their help.

Our Church is very grateful to you, the Samaritan Sacrifice Team, for the money we have been able to use to help people in need because of the war with Russia. We helped them find and rent housing, provided bed linen, and bought food. We also handed over a lot of products and various things to the military for their outfitting. The church works closely with the local military unit. Thanks to your financial support, we have the opportunity to hand over food to them every time, as well as the opportunity for transport to go to the combat zone. On the basis of our church, a logistics center has been established and organized to transport products and various medical and hygienic items to the areas affected by the bombings, as well as to the combat zones. We have specially equipped the premises, where every Sunday our church prepares dinner and invites all refugees not only to eat but to communicate with each other. Each time we give them packages of daily necessities and pray for them. Thank you for your kindness and open heart.

Peace be with you dear brothers and sisters! We greet you with the love of the Lord Jesus Christ! We received financial assistance from you in the amount of 145,689.40 kopecks. We thank God for your location and participation in helping people and the church who suffered from the hostilities in the Lugansk region. These funds were used to evacuate people from the Luhansk region, as well as to buy food packages and medicines. The following products were purchased: flour, pasta, eggs, bread, sugar, pate, cereals, sunflower oil and much more. Medicines: antipyretics, sedatives, insulin, bandages for the military. God gives opportunities to serve people, and we were able to help 600 families with food, bring 90 people out of them 30 children, and also help bring insulin to 3 people, bring water to 20 families who were left without water in the city. 1 Thessalonians 1:2, 3 “We always give thanks to God for you all, remembering you in our prayers, remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father.” Many thanks to you all and blessings from our Lord. May God supply all your needs. With love Church of the Transfiguration. Sincerely, the minister of the church Alexander Cherneta

We truly thank Samaritan's Bag for its financial support. This provided an opportunity to assist our church in covering communal expenses to provide accommodation for refugees and temporarily displaced persons. From the very beginning of the Russian aggression, our church has provided shelter for such people. Initially, these were those who needed only accommodation, and later those who needed a long-term stay. The church provides accommodation for such people and also helps church members who receive people from the east and south in their homes. Also, we have the opportunity to help people in difficult life circumstances in our city, people with disabilities. We provide assistance in transporting people from the war zone to safe places.

More than 30,000 internally displaced persons are registered in Ivano-Frankivsk. Many of them have not yet started receiving social benefits. Once a week, our Church distributes food kits to needy migrants. Last week, most of the grocery set was purchased with funds received from the Samaritan's Bag. Thanks to these funds, they were able to include canned meat in the kits. 788 such sets were issued during the day. About 100 sets remain, they were released this week. There was a separate queue for families with children, it was moving fast, but still, it was time to talk to parents and invite children to the club "The Greatest Journey"

Thank you very much for your help. Most of our church serves refugees who came to our place fleeing the war. Some families stay with us for 1-3 days and go on to Europe. At the same time, to date, we have received 70 people who live with us permanently until the end of the war. In addition, our church has organized a service at the train station where we distribute free tea, coffee, water and sandwiches. Every day 5 - 12 evacuation trains pass through our city.

Thank you very much for the money you have received, which is so much needed now, because so many people have suffered from the Russian military action in Ukraine. This help is very important, thanks to you we have helped many people in need with food kits and medicines, because there are almost no medicines in pharmacies. Many people from Marinka, Vuhledar, Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, Pokrovsk have left their homes, we feed them, leave them for the night (if necessary) and then send some by train, others are transported to safe places where there is no fighting. Part of these funds went to fuel (petrol, diesel, gas) for evacuation by buses and cars. Assistance to the disabled and the elderly was also delivered.

First of all, thank you for your help! You are the answer to prayers! When the war broke out, we evacuated the entire church to western Ukraine. This is 63 people, including 28 children. And there we needed funds for food, clothing, medicine. Each of us lost our job, so we needed a livelihood. The second direction is evacuation. During this time, we evacuated about 1,000 people from hot spots in Ukraine. The third area is humanitarian aid. During this time, we have delivered about 100,000 tons of essential products and supplies. We have 17 partner churches that take care of 75 settlements that were under occupation or that are currently under fire. In the last two areas, the costs are spent on fuel, food for drivers, car repairs.

During the war on the territory of Ukraine, our church received and continues to receive refugees from the territory of the country where active hostilities are taking place. In the house of prayer in the classrooms where Sunday school was held, we organized beds for the temporarily displaced. Every day we prepare food for them and provide for their needs (accommodation, food, clothing, transport). Since the beginning of the war, our church has received more than 180 temporarily displaced persons, and as of April 23, 2022, 30 people live on a permanent basis. Accordingly, the funds received from the Samaritan Bag are used for various needs, a lot of transportation costs, purchasing food, paying for utilities and various works related to the organization of infrastructure for the reception of people (shower equipment, laundry, heat ... and others). help you! All people living in our church are not only financially secure, but also have the opportunity to hear the Good News of Jesus Christ, and most people volunteer to attend our services. There are people who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.

<p>
The city of Cherkasy is located in the center of the country and since the beginning of the war many refugees have fled the war across the Dnieper River bridge. Our church serves all people in need of housing, food, medicine, and repairs to their vehicles. If people go further to the west of the country, we equip the road with a set of products, sleeping bags and medicines. If we stay in our region, we are looking for a place where families can live. One of the families from Kharkiv region in a small car with six small children less than two months old, barely reached us refueled with gasoline and solvents, wheels with broken bearings with a stroller just on the roof of the car !!! This family had their car repaired, refueled with gasoline, fed and warmed children, found a house in the village of our region, helped with food. Over the last Sunday, many refugees remain in our region and in our city of Cherkasy alone about eight thousand people. Every day we make grocery kits for them, if we need clothes and bedding we also help people. More than two thousand people received help. Thank you very much to the National Leadership Team of the Christmas Child Project of Ukraine for the provided funds and we are sure that the Lord will reward you for your sacrificial work in the Name of the Lord !!! God's blessing at this difficult time !!! Yours faithfully, Pastor of the Church Pavlo Shepel.

Thank you very much for your help. Most of all, our church serves refugees who came to our place fleeing the war. Some families stay with us for 1-3 days and go on to Europe. At the same time, to date, we have received 70 people who live with us permanently until the end of the war. In addition, our church has organized a service at the train station where we distribute free tea, coffee, water, sandwiches and sweets. Every day 5 - 12 evacuation trains pass through our city. And in every car of such a train, in which most people are hungry, we pass this food. Recently, other churches in our city have joined this ministry. Thank you again for helping us with this important ministry.

THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY OF THE ADVENTIST CHURCH ON THE SEVENTH DAY OF M.KOLOMIYA
</h2>
<h3>

</h3>
<p>
From the first days of the war, members of our church have already met migrants and, to the best of their ability, took people into temporary care. Today, the Kolomyia Church takes care of 46 settlers, providing them with shelter and food. The Samaritan's bag helped us to do the work we could not do. At the request of people from Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, when they were released with the funds provided by the Opportunity Charitable Foundation, we formed 300 product kits with basic products, one of which is enough for one person for one month. 50 food kits were left for people who are temporarily in Kolomyia, 100 kits were sent to the village of Nemishayevo, Kyiv region, which was under occupation, and 150 were sent to Chernihiv. Bucha, Irpen and Gostomel received the most attention in this tragedy and in the first days of liberation they were given a lot of help from all concerned people, but such villages as Nemishayevo and others were ignored, so on the advice of local people we helped them . People knowing that we would arrive in advance were waiting for us, when they received help they were very surprised by the generosity of the sets because last time they received help for 300 grams of cereal per family. We can talk a lot about people's emotions, but today everyone who is engaged in the service of charity is familiar with them. Many thanks to God for the Samaritan Bag!

Our church is very grateful for the help and we want to share the blessings that God has made through it. Since the beginning of the war, 9 families have received assistance and continue to receive it. Some stayed with us only for a while, while others live here temporarily. Families were resettled in the homes of church members. There were quite different needs - from boilers to diapers. Also for one family rented an apartment and pay for it. Another brother from the church was called up for military service and there was a need for medicine and hygiene, and he received everything on time. Families also received financial assistance, which we had and were forced to go abroad. For unbelieving families, this was a great testimony of God's love for them, and for believers, another testimony that God is near and cares for his own. Thank you again for the opportunity to serve others. May the Lord bless!

The funds we received under this project we used to purchase food, hygiene products and refuel booms with which we delivered humanitarian aid to the war zone and the export of refugees on the way back and deliver them to safe places, including abroad. We deliver aid to Kharkiv, Sumy, Trostyanets, Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Kyiv, Volnovakha and many other towns and villages and distribute food kits together with Gospels and brochures and celebrate the hope of Christ Jesus. Thank you so much for the wonderful opportunity to serve with you, may He reward you for your sacrificial heart.

<p>
We, the Christian Church "Bread of Life" in Ternopil, in connection with the situation that has occurred in our country have taken an active position to respond in all possible ways to the needs of our society. Beginning in 2014, when the first phase of military aggravation took place in Ukraine, we began our ministry for refugees and displaced persons who were forced to leave their homes in the east of the country and move to Ternopil. Then we were able to reach families with school-age children to help them with the necessary school equipment, and finally, to provide these families with food and hygiene packages for several months. Since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have realized that our city is becoming one of the epicenters for the shelter of people fleeing war zones leaving their homes. Therefore, we decided to focus on the following areas of activity: providing temporary assistance in the form of food and accommodation for those refugees who are in transit through our city and stay here for only a few days; provide long-term assistance to those who stay in our city for a long time. To do this, we purchase food and hygiene, and on the basis of our church, twice a week we organize meetings to distribute food kits. Each time, these meetings are attended by 70 to 120 people. We also send much of the food directly to the war zone to help people who have not been able to leave. The next of our projects is to provide psychological assistance to children and their parents. To this end, on the basis of our church, we organize weekly meetings attended by children and their mothers, and here our qualified ministers help them rehabilitate from stress and psychological trauma. Since one of the constant directions of our church's service was to serve the socially vulnerable category of the people of our city, today we continue to keep this group of Ternopil residents in focus and provide them with the necessary assistance. As a church, we express our sincere gratitude to the Samaritan Bag Mission for its financial assistance to reach more people and for its practical expression of compassion and mercy.

Since the beginning of hostilities on the territory of Ukraine, our public organization "Five Breads" has been actively involved in volunteer activities (reception of migrants for overnight stays and long stays, transportation of migrants to the border, help with productive packages for low-income families, trips to eastern Ukraine with food packages , military assistance and baking for the Armed Forces). Each area of volunteering requires a lot of effort and money, and financial assistance from the Samaritan Bag helps in this, namely in covering utilities, cooking lunches, arranging rooms with minimal conditions, repairing and refueling cars for trips to Kharkiv region (there were about ten) . We are sincerely grateful to God for the Samaritan Bag project. God bless.

Thank God brothers and sisters! We turn to you with sincere gratitude for the prayerful and financial support of our ministry. From the first days of the full-scale invasion, our church has come to the aid of the temporarily displaced. With your support, we have been able to organize accommodation for the temporarily displaced in the basement of the House of Prayer. They brought mattresses, organized a shower room and cooking appliances, and bought food and medicine. The Kyiv-Chop route runs through our village. Therefore, from the very first days of the war, when people were evacuated to the West and to the border, we provided places to spend the night. Some left a few days later and other people arrived. In total, about 50 people passed through our church from February to April. Where some of them were helped by transport. We especially remember the young woman who was taken out of the place of hostilities with the child she gave birth to in the basement and stayed there with her under fire for 17 days. We took her to relatives in another area. Currently, the House of Prayer is home to 20 people who have been evacuated from the scene. Some of them have completely lost their homes. The House of Prayer became their second home, we bought food, fuel, and electricity for them. In addition, we help people with internally displaced people living in our village. Dear brothers and sisters! We pray for peace in Ukraine. Pray also for our church that God will give strength and wisdom in the service of the temporarily displaced. Pray for our people who live in the House of Prayer, they all need to meet Christ. Our brothers spend a Bible hour with them.

Peace be with you, dear brothers and sisters, organizers of the wonderful "Samaritan's Bag" ministry, with gratitude in my heart in prayers I thank God for your work For the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Today is a particularly difficult time for all people in Ukraine, Russia and the United States of America. Thanks be to God that He does not leave a single person without His attention and desires that every soul acquire salvation in Christ Jesus. Your financial assistance makes a special contribution in this ministry, today we can reach many more people who do not know Christ and support those people who pray to him day and night for help, Glory to God and thank you. May the Lord bless you and meet your every need. We ask you to pray for Ukraine, not for peace to come soon, because every day it is getting more and more difficult with medicines and food and fuel at gas stations. We believe that the Lord will not leave us!

We are Christians, from the Evangelical Baptist Church in the village of Bushtino. Thanks to your finances, we were able to help people from hot spots, evacuate them, help with food and medicine. Thanks to you, with God's help, we were able to provide people with housing and provide everything they need - food, medicine, hygiene products and clothing. Both we and the migrants are very grateful to you for your support. Many families came with children, and thank God we were able to provide them with all the necessary conditions. And at the moment we continue to accept migrants, we try to provide them with everything they need. Thank you for your help and support, may the Lord bless you.

We are very grateful for the funds received! This made it possible to implement the following: 1. Evacuate people from Bucha, Kharkiv, Slavyansk and other dangerous cities to Transcarpathia, and then to other countries Czech Republic, Germany, Austria - a team of drivers from our church: Vadim, Andrew, Ostap , Mykhailo, Nazar and others… 2. Buy medicines for 15 migrants, two of whom have cancer. 3. Purchase food and basic necessities and support families who received people in our area (25 houses in the area and the pastor's home in Vynohradiv were open to displaced persons and received more than 350 people during this time)! And many people continue to live with us… 4. Thanks to the funds received from you, it was possible to bring humanitarian goods from abroad for the needs of migrants, as well as share them with various organizations: ASD Church in Berehove, private Christian school "Living Word" Lviv, Lviv community church of the SDA, public org. "Samson-winner" and other organizations and volunteers who also accept migrants… 5. Help our Armed Forces through the NGO "Transcarpathian Military Movement" also addressed to specific soldiers and brigades on the front line! There is still a lot of work to be done, but with God's help and good partners, we believe that everything will be fine! And good will surely win! Thank God !!!

Thanks for support! First of all, these funds help to support migrants from the east who have been forced to leave their homes and are in our community and neighborhood. We establish relations with them and invite them to church. One of such families (in the first photo) came from the city of Sumy, my father in the war. The family is in a difficult financial situation. The family who came from the Kharkiv region (in the last photo) were under constant fire and were forced to leave their homes and leave. The family is also in a difficult situation. People gratefully accept help. We thank you! May the Lord bless you!

Thank you very much for the help we have received from you. Our local church helps food packages and hygiene products to those people and families who have been forced to leave their homes and flee to save their lives. Many families started attending our meetings. Our sisters prepare dinners for those who come to us. There is a team of people who are always on duty at the church to help the needy. There are many different stories of how God brought people out of difficult situations, and even because of all those circumstances, they saw that God was with them. May God bless you for your generosity and much-needed help for the people of Ukraine.

The church provided funds to the Samaritan Bag to help displaced people from the occupied and devastated territories due to the war that began on February 24 in Ukraine. One part of the funds was used for people living in houses and apartments provided for them by the village council or people who settled in the houses of their relatives or acquaintances. More than three hundred such people came to the village, and the church was able to help more than two hundred people in providing food, clothing and footwear to make life and existence in our area a little easier. The second part of the funds was used to provide living conditions for people who were left without anything and could not rent or receive housing from the authorities. The House of Prayer has living rooms, showers and bathrooms, and people have the opportunity to live according to their needs. Some live a week, some two and people live permanently. So three meals a day, personal hygiene products and utilities (electricity, defects and heating) are the items of expenditure of the second part of the funds. I also want to share some testimonies of people who were able to receive help through the Church: Young family Volodya and Natasha, they have two children, a boy of 6 years and a girl of 4 years Milan. They are refugees from the village of Borodyanka, Kyiv region, when they beat Borodyanka, they ran to the basement, which was unbearably cold and lived there for some time, when they started bombing heavily, most people fled on foot and by car. When we saw even more shelling, we took the children in our arms and started running through the streets, and here we were picked up by a car, and so the Lord himself, so to speak, took us out of Borodyanka from the shelling. Arriving in our area, they settled in the House of Prayer and from the first day of their residence began to attend prayer meetings. And later, having settled down, they joined the work of the church in helping other people and directly on the land plot on the territory of the church. (Photo 1) A family from Gostomel, Kyiv region When they fired on Kyiv, they immediately ran to the basement, and when they started bombing the village of Gostomel, they had their own car, managed to take the documents and set off. Five more cars were following them, but when we left for safety, we saw that only one car was left behind, the other cars could not get out from the shelling of tanks, which mercilessly and brutally shot civilians. Having found shelter in the village, the family is grateful to God that the survivors of all those who evacuated, I was with them. (Photo 2) Grateful child for food (photo 3) Living in difficult resettlement conditions (photo 4) Cooking (photo 5)

Sincere thanks to all who support our country in this difficult time! You truly are the light of Christ! God's love is practically manifested through you! Thank you very much for that! Thanks to God, our city is in trouble. But our church could not stand aside from the plight of others. That's why we received refugees, prepared stew, porridge, baked cakes and sent it all to the place where the humanitarian catastrophe took place: in the churches of Chernihiv, Zaporizhia and Zhytomyr regions. My brothers and sisters and I also went to Borodyanka, Bucha, Irpin, and Zagaltsi to prepare food and feed people who had not seen hot food for weeks because they lacked gas, electricity, water, and heating. The brothers helped people, at least with oilcloth, to break the broken windows to keep warm and get rid of drafts in the house or apartment. We really want to serve the needy, but many of our church members have lost their jobs and their money, so we can only serve with time and work. We can do much more with you! Because to prepare porridge or stew you need money, which we do not have enough. Therefore, we truly thank you for your service! Your finances are very appropriate! People who had not seen bread or hot soup for weeks were able to quench their hunger. We also delivered food bags and necessary hygiene items to places where it is not possible to buy them. May God reward you a hundredfold for your service, open heart and sacrifice! People with tears in their eyes shared their pain and thanked for the support, for remembering them! This is very valuable today! We wish you peace, prosperity and abundant blessings of God! Your help is tangible, valuable and important! We pray for you! Bless you! Thank you very much! You can upload only 5 photos, we also have a video. If necessary, contact.

On behalf of all members of the church and parishioners, the RG HWE "SALVATION" expresses its deep gratitude to you for supporting us in such difficult times. Thanks to your support, we can continue to sow the Word of God and support hundreds of people, migrants, children, and families in crisis with food. We also serve people with disabilities in providing medical care. Children left without parental care have the full range of assistance, including food, accommodation, clothing. Displaced migrants can find asylum in our social center, which has the opportunity to exist thanks to your support. Special thanks from the father of a single person with disabilities. He is raising his 11-year-old daughter himself. My father lost one leg and the gangrene spread to the other leg just before the war. Several surgeries were performed. A skin graft operation has now been performed. It is already being corrected. The daughter is provided with full support for the period of the father's treatment. The church prepares daily dinners for children from crisis families and families in difficult family circumstances. Also, children receive dry rations daily (10-15 children). We pray for you and thank you sincerely for such a generous, timely, and significant blessing! May the Lord bless you !! May there be peace in your hearts and on your earth !! We appreciate your help and every person who is saved and every donated penny is important to us !! ????????????

Thank you for the funds provided to our church. This has helped us to better serve the needy and displaced. The funds were spent on immigrants fleeing the war, as they left the temporarily occupied territories or cities that became the scene of active hostilities. Cities and towns of such people were bombed by rockets fired at with cannons. Therefore, the funds received were used for: purchase of food, purchase of necessary medicines. Bed linen for IDPs was also purchased. A humanitarian aid point was set up on the territory of the House of Prayer. In this way, many warm clothes were distributed to people in need, as well as personal hygiene products. About 500 people were able to get temporary shelter in our city and with the help of the church received these things. Hundreds of kilograms of cereals, vegetables, oil and bread were distributed. The rest of the funds were directed to the provision of comfortable living conditions for people that the local church accepted for living in the House of Prayer: equipped beds, showers with hot water, rooms for washing personal belongings. The displaced persons were provided with warmth in the living rooms, delicious three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, dinner. Part of the money was also spent on people to whom the state provided accommodation but did not provide food. So we took care of the food for these people, and provided food for the church and for them as well. Immigrant families who had children were provided with the necessary baby items: diapers, baby food and even toys.

Residents of the village of Cherkasskoye, Slavyansky district, convey their deep, heartfelt gratitude to the people who collected and handed over food packages. It is especially difficult to live in the villages now - there is no work, social payments are delayed, the villagers are not pampered with humanitarian aid. And if in the cities people leave the war faster and more decisively, then in the villages people cannot simply abandon their households. Therefore, many become hostages of the most difficult and dangerous situation. - We are so grateful to you, unfamiliar kind people who helped us at such a time! We see with what love and sympathy these precious products were collected and delivered! God bless you for this! Elena Korobkova, the mother of a large family, expressed her general opinion.

We all together, the whole church, express our gratitude for the help we have received, it is a great help for us and we believe that the Lord works through you, thanks to Him. At the church meeting they decided how to manage the money wiser and found out that there is already a shortage of fuel briquettes, in our village there is an organization that sells briquettes, our brother works there and he said that before the war there was a small supply briquettes. Therefore, it was decided to buy briquettes for the church, namely for people who do not have the opportunity to get their own firewood or other fuel, looking in advance. These are the elderly; those with physical disabilities or health problems. Most of the money was spent on this need. A smaller part of the funds was spent on the sale of products for the church and their delivery, namely: various cereals, flour, sugar, flour, vegetables, oil. An even smaller part was left for the need of evacuation for the people. Thank you very much, thank God, for giving the workers, may the Lord bless you a hundredfold.

Peace be upon you! Thank you very much for your service! The money we receive is a great blessing from God. Thanks to this, we were able to help more than 30 people who are refugees from the war from different regions of Ukraine. Two people from our Church went to Germany to serve with a group of people with disabilities of 20 people and we blessed them with money for the trip. Refugees from the east we serve also came to our city Kivertsi. Today it is 17 people whom we help. The first was a family from Sumy - a wife and two sons. They were under fire for ten days and were very scared, they didn't know where they were going. They are believers. The Lord foresaw that our apartment was vacated and they now live there and we as a church help them with everything they need to live thanks to your money. A little later, this family was joined by another young family who also live in this apartment. We also serve them. God also brought to our city a family from Kharkiv, 4 adults and an eight-month-old baby. Their homes were bombed by the Russian occupiers. They were able to escape very quickly. And thanks to your donations, we provide them with everything you need. Another family (a woman and her daughter) live in the house of our church members. They were evacuated from Slavyansk. They are not believers, but they gladly attend our meetings, we pray for their conversion to the Lord. We also made them festive food sets for the Easter table. People thank you very much for your support and sacrificial hearts. We thank God for you and pray that the Lord will bless your sacrificial service. With prayer Pastor Serhiy.

We are very grateful to the Lord and the Samaritan Bag for the funds transferred to our church with which we are able to do many good deeds that have helped many people know the Lord as their Savior. One of them is a family of seven. 22 long days (one woman was injured in the shoulder, another with a concussion) 6 hours they walked to the place where they could pick up cars while driving through the Russian-occupied territory volunteers advised them to pray and they did not know how it was then the man advised the woman to just fold her arms to hand and bow their heads in 5 days they were able to get to our city where we had the opportunity to serve these people with their homes and finances from the Samaritan Bag financed treatment (people had injuries, pneumonia, concussions) provided the most necessary things and most importantly had the opportunity tell of the Lord Savior of Whom they knew almost nothing before Now having lost all home all they rejoice in their possessions that they have found the most important treasure of the Lord Christ. Also through our city is the main railway line on which evacuation trains with refugees moved, people were scared hungry, we had the opportunity and funds to give these people food, medicine and baby food. We also served orphans who lost their parents during the fighting.

The funds have not yet been used in full. But today a washing machine has been bought for IDPs living in the dormitory of the Sosnivsky Vocational Lyceum (UAH 7,000). Also, one of the members of the church had a family from the village of Piskivka (near the village of Borodyanka). Sergei Kaznacheyev, 16, bought clothes (sports pants and a sweater). After all, the family left without things, in a hurry. And the guy has a height of 195 cm and the 45th size of shoes. It was problematic to find clothes (it is UAH 500). And another member of the church was allocated 30,000 hryvnias for urgent surgery on the skull.

<p>
Thanks to the financial support of the Bagar Samaritan ICF, the Church of the Salvation Church in Cherkasy was able to organize and carry out evacuations from cities and regions of Pryluky, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, Kryvyi Rih, Nikopol, Myrhorod, and Mykolayiv. Thanks to material support, we were able to purchase precious fuel. On the way, during the evacuation, which sometimes took several days, we had the opportunity to provide people with hot meals, warm clothes, accommodation in hotels or local churches. Always in communication with people, they knew from whom help (Samaritan's Bag) and that Christians from all over the world are raising funds to support Ukrainians during the war. About 130 people were evacuated to Truskavets, Lviv, and Cherkasy from places where others refused, and our faith in God and confidence in security was felt by the people. The people were very surprised that they were being helped without asking for anything in return, but to love the Lord our God with all their heart, and with all their soul, and with all their strength! The story of Levchenko's family Ilona, Olga and Victor from Mykolayiv. They were evacuated to Cherkasy on March 24. All the while, the family hoped that their grief would pass and the rockets would not fly into their house. but unfortunately on March 21 the bomb hit the Ingul Hotel and their house nearby was damaged. And thank God, thanks to the good relations between the Church of the Salvation and Jewish organizations in Ukraine, these people turned to the Jewish community for help and the Jewish community asked for our help. Thanks to good coordination, we were able to gather people in different cities these people were brought to Cherkasy. Since all the brothers and sisters have already shared housing with the refugees, they had to rent housing for these people at the expense of the Samaritan's Bag project. Also with the funds of the Samaritan's Bag project, we have the opportunity to bring the Gospel to refugees in need. Since the beginning of the funds, we have purchased and distributed more than 350 product kits. the price of one product set ranges from 280 to 300 UAH

The proceeds were spent on families with children fleeing the war. Purchase of grocery kits, purchase of children's shoes, fuel for cars and feeding children. This is a very important help. We can't help everyone, but we could help some. People are not fleeing poverty but war. We showed them that God cares about them. They talked about hope in Jesus. People are grateful. Great need. We want to buy shoes for children of migrants - a great demand and request from parents. We also continue to feed children and help with food. We ask you to continue to help. We are sincerely grateful to all the people who sacrifice for this service !!!

Since the beginning of the full-scale offensive on Ukraine, our church has been actively involved in the ministry for refugees. We receive people every day. During the bombings of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Kyiv region, huge flows of about 150 people a day began in our church alone. We provide people with free accommodation in the church, food and clothing. We also deliver them if necessary and try to provide medical and moral assistance. The biggest expense is providing heat to people's living quarters, as well as feeding such a large number of people. One of the brightest stories of refugees about a family from Chernihiv region. The husband and wife, their daughter and two grandchildren were under occupation. Russian soldiers broke into their house and began to live there. They took their food and things. The man was interrogated several times and even shot in the head. Taking advantage of the moment, the family fled without anything, money or other means of subsistence. Miraculously, they got to our church. We gave them shelter. They gave the necessary clothes. Provided with food. Later, they were able to return to the territory already cleared of occupiers. We thank the Samaritan Bag for helping to carry out the great work of helping the Ukrainian people in difficulty.

Congratulations brothers and sisters. Thank you for your help and indifference to the problems that have arisen in our country with the beginning of the extremely brutal and fascist war. , spend the night, eat, get help and advice on various issues. Approximately 200 beds were arranged. A large number of people asked to settle in our community. Therefore, it was necessary to complete and put in order those uninhabited buildings that belong to our church and its members. Gas stoves (cylinders) were purchased for this purpose, and water was provided for two buildings. The depth of the well was drilled and a water supply system was created (pump, pipes, etc.). bag of help "(products, hygiene products, etc.). We are also given lists for the purchase of medicines. Among the refugees are people with disabilities who need constant help. Thank the Lord and all who care for help and pray for peace and an end to the war.

First of all, we thank you for your financial support. It is gratifying that together with you we can serve the needy. Ever since the war in Ukraine began, my family and my church and I have been accepting immigrants. In total, our church received 45 immigrants who have been living in our homes for a long time. Thanks to financial support, we were able to improve the places of residence of migrants, buy heaters, food, pay for utilities. We also went for four weeks to a children's boarding school for children who had been relocated from Dnipro. About 70 children heard the Word of God almost every day, where we distributed Samaritan Bags, conducted Bible lessons, needlework, sports, and music. We are glad that the children really wanted to have the New Testament, when we gave it to them, many people started reading and asking a lot of questions. During this period, six children repented in the boarding school. We plan to continue to visit these children, but once a week. It was also a great blessing for us that last year we distributed 200 Samaritan Bag gifts during the camp, and now, in the spring, up to 100 children came to a meeting that we arranged for them in nature.

We thank the Lord that during this difficult time of trial, you have been able to support about 45 refugees who have settled in our city and to cover transportation costs, food, medicine and hygiene. Among the photos… Sasha is 15 years old - he lived in Bucha and said that at the time when Russian troops came to the city, as his relatives were military, he was also interested in this case and he enlisted in the defense, while there he witnessed terrible things, and over time, the volunteers who surrounded him were killed and taken prisoner. After holding him for several days and taking the phone he had with him, he was released, and he and his mother went to Kremenets to the house where his grandmother, who died this fall, lived. Sasha said that he is recovering well in Kremenets… he is currently studying at a local school and plans to live in Kremenets. Last week they returned to pick up things and there they dug up and destroyed the whole apartment and the occupiers hung a mine on the window… Thank God they saw.

First of all, thank you to God and to you for providing money at a very necessary and difficult time for people to help them in their most necessary needs. The funds were used for food to feed refugees fleeing the cities where the fighting took place and, if necessary, to provide them with accommodation. There were people who asked to take their families out and take them to places where they would be safe, the money was spent on gasoline and diesel fuel. And today the funds are mainly used for food kits for people in need. People thank you very much for your help. May the Lord bless you. Thank you !!!

One of the days when aid was distributed to refugees. Among dozens of people handed a package of food to two young women and their mother prayed for them, asked for God's protection and comfort for them, they thanked and left the church. About 10 minutes later I go out to the churchyard and see these women sitting right in the middle of the street in a circle and crying, I approached and asked them what had happened, and they answered me through tears - "Our homes in Kharkov are being destroyed by Russians, and you to us give food for free thank you ”I translated the glory to God and tried to support them. He came to the funeral of the husband of a sister from our church, he was killed by racists when a column of their horde entered Voznesensk, he wanted to preach in the cemetery, but crying over the coffin he barely said not to bear unforgiveness in his heart. criminals. They moved the family closer, helped financially and spiritually, now they help at the church to prepare hot dinners for the needy. Stopping the car in the yard of high-rise buildings, I answer the message on the phone, I see an acquaintance of the boy loading his things into the bus, got out of the car to say hello, and he says he arrived for a few days, and today again goes to the post 50 km from the city. I prayed for him, brought him canned food, groceries, asked him to take a picture and wrote when he got there. He sends me a photo the next day, where they found a family with children and gave them some of their products, and wrote to me - "we also help" Thank God that we have such a military. The church now feeds 40-50 people daily. On Sunday at lunch my father meets a grandfather who came to eat and tells me - I ate for the last time the day before yesterday and today I came to eat again because you have very tasty, and my father asks - why don't you come every day? The old man answers - it's a shame… Holy God, why do Ukrainians have such a shy holiday. The woman left Nikolaev as the child. She came to the church to receive food aid together with Darynka, who prayed for them one year after the distribution of food kits, and she then asked me as a priest if I could baptize a child. home. On Sunday, this woman brought her child for blessing and, being an unbeliever, asked me to pray for her Gift. for the period 24.04 the church feeds 40-50 people daily. Approximately once in 10 days organizes the distribution of food kits for migrants and children with many children. We take out people from Nikolaev. They placed several refugee families in their homes. Finances go to fuel, food, medicine. transport service.

Thank God we are a small church of 35 members where there are several couples of young people - for two months now we have been accepting refugees. If from the beginning of the war people were traveling in transit - they stayed only for 1-2 nights, now people who have nowhere to run have arrived and found shelter in our church. Now we are helping 44 displaced people. We feed them 3 times a day, they have the opportunity to wash themselves. In our church in Yarmolintsy we continue to conduct a children's ministry. Refugee children, our children and a little from our village come to the meetings. Fewer children came from Yarmolynets themselves, since it is impossible for children alone to walk the streets, only with their parents. In addition to the 8 rooms that were in the prayer house, we equipped 2 more rooms for refugees during the war. The second last room that could be converted for human habitation we did last week. We made repairs there, made beds, made the window open. It remains to find mattresses here and we are ready to receive people. A group of people is already asking us from the Kharkiv region. We continue to serve people in need with food, diapers, chemicals. We received a request to help people in the village. Zinkov. This is a group of refugees from the Donetsk region. They live in a rural school and needed elementary school. What we were able to share materially, and presented the New Testament, called them to turn to the Lord. At the end of the conversation, they prayed for them. We are gradually building relationships with people who now live in the house of prayer. Almost everyone regularly attends our morning and evening meetings, begins to read the Bible on their own, and prays. Thank God and many thanks to our partners for helping our church... May the Lord bless everyone.

In difficult times of war, these funds were a great blessing to our church. We were able to help many migrants. We helped a family from Kharkiv financially so that they and their friends could buy fuel to evacuate their city. We buy the things they need and food for the displaced people who live near our church and around our church ... We also had the opportunity to help other displaced people who live farther away from us and were in great need of food and other important things and medicines. With these funds, our church has prepared food and hygiene kits for the families of church members and friends, because in such a difficult time for our country, these benefits are necessary and important for every family. Our church plans to continue to support the families of immigrants and church members, as well as those in need. We thank Sumka Samaritan for his very important support, both in prayer and in money. We really appreciate your support. Thank God for all of you.

We live in the tourist town of Yaremche. Since the beginning of hostilities in Ukraine, thousands of people have come to us, because there are so many different recreation centers and hotels. The city authorities organized the reception of refugees in two secondary schools, and many people received migrants for free. The funds you have allocated have helped us a lot in serving these people. We were able to buy small appliances and some medical devices, bought the necessary medicines, which were not available in many pharmacies in our city, bought shoes and necessary food, some utensils. Part of the money went to fuel for the car during the purchase of necessities and assistance in resettlement. People are sincerely grateful for your help. We tell everyone that we are only postmen and that only God is the sender of all this. We are sincerely grateful and personally for the trust and help shown in serving people.

<p>
From the first days of the war in our country, the small church in the village of Simer began to accept people who were forced to leave their homes due to bombing and shelling. There were families who stayed for a few days and, if possible, went abroad. But there were and there are families that remain with us to this day. Most siblings adopted two or three families with children. A sincere thank you to the Samaritan Bag for the funds, which have been a great support and blessing to many refugees. After all, food, hygiene products and medicines were necessary for living. Transportation of people for medical examinations, sometimes long-term treatment for two weeks, all of which required costs that the refugees did not have. Some have already fled the house when it was completely destroyed and they have only the documents and things they left with. People are grateful for the warmth, for the opportunity to sleep even on a mattress, but in silence, for food and medicine - they thank the Lord and you who have shown Christian love and care for the needy. God bless you, dear Samaritan Bag team!

We spent the money provided to us from the Samaritan's Bag as follows: we receive immigrants in the church, they spend the night with us, we feed them, and then send them abroad, and there were about 25 people in our church every day (350-400 in total) who needs to stay, they stayed with us in the church for a long time. And we understand that in order to feed so many people 3 times a day, we need finances, to send each person abroad, we need finances to buy (who of the migrants needs medicine) it takes money and the money from the Samaritan's Bag helped us a LOT in this, thank you God bless you.

Since the beginning of the war, the Church of Bethlehem has provided various assistance: - human settlements - humanitarian aid for migrants (food, clothing, hygiene products and medicines) - humanitarian aid to the cities most affected by the war - evacuation of people from hot spots - spiritual support - children center At the church, volunteers meet and settle people who come from dangerous places in Ukraine. Church members also respond to help and receive whole families in their homes. It is said that there are almost no empty houses left in the city, and some have several families. Some stop for a while and go on to other Ukrainian cities or abroad. However, many families remain in Dunaivtsi.

One family from Kharkiv was helped to evacuate to a safe area and later travel abroad. They lived on the 12th floor. When the shelling began, they were sitting in a shelter. One day they decided to go up to their apartment and take the children's clothes. 20 minutes after leaving home, their apartment was destroyed. When we said goodbye to them at the border, they said, "We don't know where we're going, but we have nowhere to go." We also gave the children Samaritan packages that were left at that time. It was fun and support during this difficult time. Lunches are being prepared for temporarily settled people. About 450 people per thousand children were taken to the Ustyluh border, 2 evacuation flights were made from Kyiv, 2 flights from Sumy region, and from Chernihiv region. In Volyn, about 100 people found refuge in the homes of church members. They are provided with periodic assistance in the most necessary things. There is constant assistance to low-income people. We deliver hygiene products and products to the evacuation sites.

<p>
Thanks to the partners for their help. From the very beginning of the war, our church has created conditions for the reception of refugees from places that have come under fire. Thanks to your support, we were able to expand the activities of assistance, namely: The church has 27 beds. 4-room, 3-room and 1-room apartments, 3 houses were rented and people were temporarily accommodated in the housing of church ministers. To do this, the property was equipped with everything necessary for living: refrigerator, washing machine, heaters, electric stoves, mattresses, boilers, bed linen, blankets, pillows. We pay utility bills for rented property and provided premises. In the period from 24.02 to 24.04 received about 250 people, of which 60 people are permanent residents. They also provided people with food and medicine. About 300 people bought and handed over food kits to pensioners, socially vulnerable people, families who lost their jobs and migrants who applied. Funds were allocated for fuel to evacuate people from Mariupol. Three bunk beds have been transferred to equip the apartment of the Armed Forces. This allowed people to show the love of Christ and to preach the gospel. After the liberation of the city of Chernihiv, we support the ministers who bring there the necessary things. Unfortunately, the war continues and people do not stop going. We find housing and provide people with permanent residence. For many, it is a problem to adapt and find a job. Also, your finances help us complete the construction of housing that will serve the people. Our joint efforts have enabled the church not only to maintain all ministries and ministers, but also to increase them. So on a regular basis we continue to help local needy people. Reintegration centers for men and women operate. Evangelistic, youth, missionary services are held. Thank you again for your support, may the Lord sincerely bless you.

 thank God for the opportunity to work with the Samaritan Bag for many years. And in this difficult time for our country, your support is felt more than ever. We have been able to provide both physical and financial assistance to many IDPs from the war zone. And we continue to work in this direction. This is assistance and resettlement in different homes, this is the provision of medical advice to various specialists as needed, providing the necessary things and personal hygiene products, assistance in leaving for temporary residence for the crown. We really need your help and we appreciate it. We also ask for prayerful support so that God may give us the wisdom and vision of the immediate needs of those who turn to us for help. Thank you again for your sacrificial support. May the Lord bless and strengthen you in this ministry and expand the boundaries of your ministry.

<p>
As soon as the war broke out in Ukraine, we as a church began to help the affected and displaced. We relocated our school at the church to a refugee reception center. In school classrooms we bought mattresses, bed linen and settled migrants. Among the refugees we have, we have many young children and adults. The eldest grandfather is 92 years old. The youngest boy is 1 week old, he was born here. There are families with disabilities. In total, we have more than 100 people in affluent churches. Since the church premises do not allow us to accept all these people, in parallel with the church we look for houses for them and settle there, continuing to take care of them. One we help with medicine, another with food and a place to live, and the other we help to go abroad. We prayed that God would help us financially because the work we started was difficult for us. We saw that it was difficult for my 92-year-old grandfather to lie on the mattress on the floor. Similarly, it is difficult for a mother with a breastfed baby to constantly lean on the mattress to feed the baby. We started thinking about beds and other necessities for living conditions. And God answered us right away through the Samaritan Bag project. When we were praying, I got a call from your project wanting to help with finances. Tears in my eyes and words of gratitude to our great God for the immediate response. The next day I told this experience to the migrants who live here and said that there would be help. A washing machine, a vacuum cleaner, system clothes hangers, a refrigerator and an electric stove were purchased for the living conditions. Also sleeping beds. That is, with your help we have made living conditions comfortable. In our center we provide three meals a day, a shower and a place to sleep. We worry about utility costs to be good. For the second month, the church has been providing shelter to people who have lost their homes or have war-torn homes. Living here, they have peace and tranquility in their hearts. We continue to work, this work does not stop because life goes on and food, warmth and comfort are needed every day. Also helping materially, we share the Word of God with people by giving them Bibles and other spiritual literature. Most migrants have psychological trauma from what they saw and experienced during the fighting, so they need a word of hope from a loving God. We continue to work and believe that a good God will help us. We do everything possible and depend on us to serve God and people in this difficult time for our country. We truly thank you for that great love and care for us and our country. May the good God bless you. As soon as the war broke out in Ukraine, we as a church began to help the affected and displaced.

Thank you for your help! Our church is helping refugees with food at this difficult time. We have created social packages that have food for approximately 1 month. Sometimes people stop and spend the night right in the House of Prayer. Some are dedicated to living in our families. Also, they tried to work with displaced children. Circles and a small program were organized for them. The funds from the Samaritan's Bag also served well in this case! Parents were delighted, because children often feel lonely in a strange city without friends, without home and certainty. And there was an opportunity to communicate and have fun. We take care of people not only in our city, but also in the surrounding villages, because they come from different places.

Christ is Risen! We apologize for not writing about our affairs for so long. The days go by so fast that we didn't even notice that a month had passed since the day we received the money. Let's briefly describe what is happening here now. It is the 60th day of the war. New people come to our community every day. If earlier most of them had families who traveled by car, now they are people who are evacuated through green corridors. These are often single mothers, elderly people and people with disabilities. To the best of our ability, we accept accommodation and temporary accommodation for all who need it. Thanks to your support, we can provide people with food, warmth and daily necessities. Thank you very much! Our Mother and Child Home "Good Mother" today has 24 people, including 16 internally displaced persons who came from the area where the fighting is taking place. 8 people are single mothers with children who do not have a permanent place of residence. We try to keep them all. In total, we have already fed, warmed and supported 71 people. Our youngest resident who settled in "Good Mother" was only 2 months old, and the oldest - 94 years old. Everyone has their own story, their own experiences. Among the people who live here are those who have already completely lost their home. They have nowhere to return, their house (apartment) was blown to pieces by missiles fired by the enemy. We communicate a lot with local authorities. Every day we exchange information with the center that registers refugees. We have the opportunity to help people not only with food and housing, but also with humanitarian aid that we receive from friends from Germany and the Netherlands. These are clothes, shoes, children's toys, rehabilitation aids. Many people come sick and exhausted, because they have been in the basement for a long time, where it is cold, damp and unsanitary. Your funds have also been used to pay for medical services for internally displaced persons. If you are interested in the following letter, we can describe some stories of people who came to us about their lives during the war. Two weeks ago, we started a new project - the construction of housing for people left homeless. This is an expensive project, so we have long hesitated whether we will be able to implement everything. Thanks to the Lord and friends who support our activities, we decided to start the reconstruction of our old house. If you are interested in learning more about construction, we will be happy to describe everything. Sorry for the big text, but I want to tell you everything. Our people are experiencing so much pain now. It is not easy to find the right words for those people who have said goodbye to their relatives forever… But we are strong and believe that everything will end soon. Thank you very much for your understanding and support. We appreciate your friendship with you! We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate you on the bright holiday of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ!

Hearts are overflowing with gratitude for the support of the church in these difficult times. This is God's grace, because we have been able to continue to serve the poor, the needy, the soldiers, and those in need. Thanks to these finances, they were able to complete the renovation of the room in order to receive refugees. While they are gone, we hold a Sunday school there. We pay for the operation to a girl who is being raised by her mother and is in a difficult situation. This is a great testimony for them! My mother said that when they were taken to the hospital she was afraid and panicked, because there was no money for treatment. When she learned that the church wanted to help financially, her eyes filled with tears. She is now very eager to hear the gospel. We pray and believe that after the treatment we will continue to work with them. The church is infinitely grateful for the help !!! Thank you for not stopping our ministry! May the Lord give thanks 100 times!

Using funds from the Samaritan Bag: 1) we serve at the railway station: we help refugees, distribute free tea and feed the needy, as well as settle in recreation rooms and deliver food and water packages to evacuation train cars, water is especially important for passengers of such trains. , but food is also very important, because there were cases when people who got to safe places in Ukraine for 2-4 days did not eat anything); 2) for many refugees the place to spend the night is their own homes of members of our church (sometimes we have to receive seven "guests" at a time); 3) once a week (every Wednesday) we feed people who find themselves in difficult life circumstances. First we feed them spiritual food (short sermon, prayer, psalm for guitar or accordion, and only then we distribute delicious porridge and tea). Because of this ministry, one man decided to change his life and was sent to a rehabilitation center, where funds were also transferred for his maintenance. 4) from time to time we go around fasting, testify about Jesus and distribute sweets.

We would like to express our deep gratitude to the "Samaritan's Bag" mission for charitable assistance at a difficult time for our country, and especially for our native Kramatorsk. Your finances supported our city in a difficult time, when all production in the city stopped and people were left without salaries. Your finances helped us to buy food, we collected food packages and distributed socially low categories of people in our city, these were pensioners, the disabled, low-income and large families. We also purchased food and personal hygiene products for the evacuation center in our city. Hundreds of people daily passed through this center from Donetsk, Kharkiv and Lugansk regions. To this day, in our house of prayer, twice a week we hold hot charity dinners for all those in need. Passes about 60 people. Also, part of the funds was spent on gasoline for the evacuation of people. We continue to work on the fields of God. Receive Greetings and Blessings from the Good News Church

In our city, many people stopped for the night, on the way west. Our church was able to serve families with accommodation, food, clothing. - We have established a daily duty to provide material assistance to internally displaced persons. We buy grocery kits, necessary household items for families of migrants. About 300 families have already received such assistance. Some families we took on regular support. This became our main ministry during the war. - Helping the victims - we prepared canned food for the victims and volunteers on behalf of the church. - Families with children were also able to get OSS children's handouts.

The funds received from the Samaritan's Bag help us to accept people who are forced to flee the war. We have daily new people at the peak of the escape we took 340 people in at night. The funds allow us to buy various products: bread, baked tea and coffee, delicious to feed these people, many of whom have lost everything they had. The war continues and the geography of the people is constantly changing and now people are fleeing new cities occupied and destroyed by Russia. We try to create the most comfortable conditions, to testify to God's love, to distribute the Gospel. We are grateful to you for your help to the Ukrainian people at this terrible time.

Since the beginning of the war, the church has taken an active part in serving the settlers. With the help of funds from the Samaritan Bag, we deliver breakfasts at checkpoints, have the opportunity to receive families of migrants from the East, distribute grocery bags and clothes at the city's Volunteer Center. In addition, we hold a weekly children's service for displaced families, followed by hot lunches. Many unbelieving families come to our Sunday services! Thank you for your help!

Dear service partners, we truly thank you for the support and help of our people in such a sad and anxious time, a time of war. Thank you to the Lord and to you for not shedding tears and supporting people, both in prayer and in deed. Unfortunately, the area where our church is located is dangerous, it has come under shelling and bombing. But despite the circumstances, the children of God continue to serve not in word but in deed. Because the building of our House of Prayer is in a dangerous place, we are not able to accommodate the displaced, but we are helping as much as we can. A group of sisters from our church gathers and prepares food for the settlers, namely, making dumplings, baking pies, etc. They were able to help families who came from Kyiv region with clothes and food kits. Many migrants live in the villages around our city. The family of Victor and Irina and their three children came from Gostomel, the poor escaped, leaving home and all things, came without clothes, food. They felt the horror of the war when a group of armed Chechen soldiers came to their home. The Lord showed His mercy to them, according to Irina, their neighbors were shot, and God saved their lives. We provided them with clothes, food and everything they needed. One day after the service, a family from Bucha came to the church, they had to leave their city, two women with a little boy and an old grandfather, found shelter in our city, needed clothes, we gave it to them. Also in the neighboring village of Demkivtsi lived families from Bucha who needed food, the Lord helped us meet their needs and testify to them of His love. One of our setters lives near a military facility, after its bombing, her home became uninhabitable, she is a widow and has no one to help her. When the explosions were heard, the windows were broken, the door was damaged, and now we are restoring her house. We truly thank you, dear partners, for your support and participation in the needs of our people, thank God that we are able to represent it. God's blessing, support and inspiration!

Thank you very much for your funds. These funds provided assistance to families (refugees) affected by the war with Russia. The main part of the funds was used for fuel and lubricants: for the evacuation of people from hot spots (Irpen, Bucha, Chernihiv, etc.) - spent about $ 2,000, for the purchase of basic necessities (hygiene products, products, medicines) - spent about 2 $ 000. Temporary shelter (housing) for refugees, hot meals - about $ 1,000 was organized. May the Lord bless you for your sacrifice and help to Ukraine in these difficult times for us and return you a hundredfold!

Thank the Lord for the people who were able to give us money to help people from the east. Our church opened its doors to people without a home, with animals and children, the elderly. Grocery kits, shoes and food, fuel costs and food delivery. We used half the amount.

Hello! Our church is very grateful for the money you received, as we can say with confidence that it has helped many families in our parish. First of all, these were large families who are still in Ukraine without leaving their homes, who have at least 4 young children, and whose parents lost their jobs due to this war. We also used some of the money to buy everything we needed for IDPs who are still staying at our retreat (these people are constantly changing). May God thank you for all your actions and give you a hundred times more !!!

Due to hostile aggression by Russia, many people were forced to leave their homes and seek refuge in neighboring regions, districts, cities and villages. Our village is no exception, we are currently visited by 800 internally displaced persons, whom we are happy to help. In fact, we would not be able to do much without the money we received from the Samaritan Bag, so we thank God and you for the opportunity to serve the people who need it most. Since receiving the funds, we have provided about 100 people with food and Kyiv in order to hand over food and everything necessary to our defenders. Our church takes part in free daily lunches for migrants, where we also invest financial aid. Thank you very much for your support and prayers. Next - more. Bless you!

<p>
In our city (Mohyliv-Podilskyi) there was one of the few existing customs for crossing the border with Moldova, so through our city there was a large flow of people who saw abroad. We were able to help many of them by having our church members receive them in their homes by giving them food and lodging. One evening I received 16 refugees from the town of Chasiv Yar, Donetsk region, in my 3-room apartment (photo 1), and my wife and I had to sleep on the kitchen floor. So our church was able to accept about 1,000 people. Some of the refugees stayed in our city for a long time, so we were able to help more, we provided them with food, necessities (clothes, bedding, hygiene products), in some cases reimbursed the cost of utilities. We were able to provide special assistance to the foster family, Ivan and People, who moved to us with their nineteen foster children (photo 2). In total, we helped about 300 refugees who remained to live in our area. We also noted that many of the IDPs needed medical care and we ran a medical clinic for them at the church. For this purpose, highly qualified doctors came to us from the city of Vinnytsia - cardiologist, therapist, vertebrologist, in addition, there were specialists who performed ultrasound examinations and ECG. The refugees received good advice, and according to them we bought them the necessary medicine (photo 3,4). Also, in addition to serving in our city, we were able to help 20 small churches in villages within a radius of 70 km around our city, providing them with products and things to serve refugees (photo 5 - Brother Alexander on a homemade tractor takes help to his village).

Hello! Thank you very much for the financial support of our church in the reception and shelter for migrants. During the two months of the war, we were able to receive more than 150 people who stayed for several days and weeks, and some of them have been living in the church building all this time. With the money provided, we were able to complete 2 more rooms in the house of prayer. They bought 13 bunk beds, were able to install an electric boiler and pay for electricity. We are also trying to fully provide the people living in the church with food. We also help with food and clothing of other migrants from our village, and sometimes other villages.

Since the beginning of the war, God has shown the needs and opened the hearts of our brothers and sisters to help those in need. Thanks to financial support from the Samaritan Bag, more than 100 people have been able to be accommodated and accommodated so far, internally displaced persons are provided with food in the families where they live, financially supported and cared for. They were also able to generate and send to the front line products, medicines and generators for the military (in Mykolaiv region). Humanitarian cargoes were formed and sent to people in Irpen and surrounding villages. They held an Easter program and invited migrant children, where they were able to serve through gifts from the Samaritan Bag Mission. Thank God for the opportunity to serve others with what we have!

Thank God, the Christmas Child Project team is blessed! We received financial support from you in difficult times for our country and the Lord gave us the opportunity to spend these funds to serve people who found themselves in difficult circumstances, left without a home, food, medicine ... On the basis of our church were prepared 70 beds and conditions for hygiene for people who needed a roof over their heads for one or two nights, food and spiritual support. There are families who have been living with us for more than a month because they have nowhere to go ... During the war, our church provided shelter to 1,800 people and continues to work in this direction. We also began serving people who remained in broken cities and towns. Having purchased products (more than 6 thousand kg) and medicines, we make food kits and take them to people who are in dire need of it. Such food kits were delivered to Kyiv, Konotop, Chernihiv, Berezanka and the village of Kyivka in the Chernihiv region. The people there have experienced hostilities on their own, it is difficult to look them in the eye, because their gaze is so full of pain and despair. Too many houses have been destroyed to the ground, not a single house has survived. These people have no food and no place to buy it. But these people testify to how they cried out to God during tank battles near their homes, during rocket fire, and the Lord saved their lives. When they receive the bread, they kiss it with tears in their eyes and thank them sincerely. We would like to sincerely thank you for your support and direct participation in this ministry. After all, by sacrificing for these people, we together touch their hearts and bring them not only physical bread, but also spiritual bread, testifying to them about the love of Christ in action! May the Lord bless everyone who took part in this !!!

The funds were used to buy food and many other necessities. Your finances have been a blessing to many people who have been forced by war to leave their homes and seek refuge in the western regions. May the Lord continue to bless you all abundantly!

Congratulations, blessed brothers and sisters, partners in our ministry. Thanks to the help you received, the Church of Stara Pisochna was able to bless many IDPs in our and neighboring villages. The Yahovkin family, having moved to the village of Kupin, needed hot water and a washing machine, we helped them to solve these needs and thanks to that we established good friendly relations. In the village of Stara Pisochna, in early March, a family of Telichens from Bucha settled near the House of Prayer, we helped them find a house, bought a refrigerator, and also provided two food kits. In the village of Stara Guta, in cooperation with the mayor, we visited 8 families from Mariupol, Chernihiv, Dergachi, and blessed them with food kits for each family, and one of these days we plan to help these families buy a washing machine.

We are a small church in the west of Ukraine (42 people) and when more than 100 refugees came to us at the beginning of the war, it was quite difficult for us to accept everyone, accommodate and help. Your financial support was very timely and necessary for us! Thank you, dear brothers and sisters, for your financial help. With these funds we were able to help refugees pay for apartment rent, composting, treatment and food. We received not only believers, many non-believers, thanks to this ministry, dedicated their lives to Jesus! So may the Lord bless you abundantly for your ministry!

For two months we received people from different parts of Ukraine, where the fighting took place. These were people from Bucha, Kharkiv and cities of Donetsk region. Thanks to the Samaritan's Bag, we were able to help them, namely to buy them everything they need for life: food, bedding, hygiene products, things necessary for rehabilitation (walkers, etc.). We also helped large families in our church. We also have a sister who is expecting a son and a husband from the war, so thanks to the Samaritan's Bag, we were able to support her during this difficult time. Also, thanks to the Samaritan's Bag, we helped people who were unemployed at the time and were under fire all the time!

<p>
Never before in my life have I felt such unity of people in achieving one goal - achieving peace in Ukraine !!! Residents of peaceful Ukraine were caught in a terrible disaster. People had to leave everything and flee to save their children, elderly parents. God has strengthened us in a beautiful place where so far we can only hear the sound of sirens, but not the sound of bombs. Therefore, it is our duty to help those who have left everything and left their homes. The Lord has given us the House of Prayer, where we have been able to receive many immigrants. Some stayed for a few days, others stayed in the House of Prayer for another month. Everyone who lives is provided with three meals a day, baby food, hygiene items and necessities. We are also helping the soldiers of Svalyava region, who are going to the front line, to protect our native Ukraine with food kits !!! Thank you sincerely, dear brothers and sisters, for helping us to share our grief not only in prayer but also in a tangible way! May the Lord bless you abundantly for your sincerity and compassion. Only together we will win !!!

We bought food and medicine for the hostel, which we made on the territory of the former village council. Funds were sent for the treatment of a girl with cancer. We truly thank the Lord and the entire Samaritan Bags team for the opportunity to help those in need. May the Lord bless you abundantly.

Thanks to the funds received in the church, we were able to equip a "laundry" room, where migrants can wash and dry their clothes, provide homeless people with proper hygiene. The church also regularly receives immigrants, feeds them free of charge and provides overnight stays for several nights. The church also has a kitchen, where volunteers make their own preparations and, if necessary, give food to those in need. Part of the funds was also used for the purchase and transfer of food to regions where the situation is extremely difficult. The Church has been a testimony of God's love to many who did not know God before or feared believers as sectarians. One day, volunteers took 4 elderly people from Mariupol to church, but people panicked because they were afraid that they had been driven into a sect and that they would do something with them. The women needed to be reassured, but the church was able to show God's love so much that the settlers themselves left notes of thanksgiving that they were received with such love and warmth in this church. Every time people spread contacts on social networks and provide links to the church, where they can help. The church also helps Ukrainians who are not immigrants, but lost their solvency due to the war. This is how a young woman with two children approached us, she does not have enough money for baby food and the church is constantly trying to buy baby milk and diapers. Recently, a young family from Kharkiv appeared in the church, they rent housing in Vinnytsia, but there were no funds for pillows, blankets and bed linen. The church was able to provide for this family. Many immigrant families are now joining the church, who, seeing their love for themselves, also want to serve others.

During this difficult time, people from the church lost their jobs, refugees began to come. We, as a church, faced a lack of funds. packages for refugee children (food, sweets, stationery), detergents, as well as cereals, vegetables, sugar, pasta, flour for places where refugees live. It's so nice to see people start reading God's Word. We also gave the children of our city and the refugee children gifts from the Samaritan's Bag when they were in the basements during the siren. It is nice to see the children smiling. Thank you, may God increase the increase.

Good, peaceful evening! Christ is risen! We have a kind of service, not like everyone else ... The sisters of our church have processed almost 1000 kg of cabbage on a roll since the beginning of the war (2-3 times a week they are taken to Chernivtsi to the coordination center and distributed there). ... The rooms of the house of prayer were equipped with bathrooms, which were equipped with washing machines and dryers. We invite them to the service, three families with children are already regular visitors to the service, the children attend a guitar group at the church. Somehow we have ... thank you for everything to our Lord !!!!

The Dawn of Life Church in Khmelnytsky received funds from the Samaritan's Bag service on March 23. This will be quite timely, because from the very beginning of the war a center for the reception of migrants was established on the basis of the church's prayer house. Immigrants often need the most basic items: clothing, hygiene products, food. Therefore, with these funds we began to purchase and sell on a regular basis: - Essentials (underwear, socks, sneakers, sports pants) - Children's toys for children of migrants - Products for the formation of food kits Migrants are very grateful for the care and practical care, often express it with tears in your eyes! We are grateful to the Samaritan Bag for financial assistance in this important ministry!

During this time, the Tereblya Church received more than 40 people, including children and seven of them with foster children. We are grateful to God and to you, dear members of the Samaritan Bag Mission, for your tangible financial assistance in our service to these people. With these funds we could pay for utilities (gas, electricity), equip bathrooms at the church (some refugees had to live on the church balcony and the funds helped us to start these units in time). We also used these funds to buy food, shoes, send a parcel to a soldier of the Armed Forces (from our church, for example, a very important thing - a powerful mobile battery charger, for which this man is VERY grateful), as well as fuel and transportation costs. Thanks again! God bless you.

We thank God and you for your great financial contribution to support internally displaced persons during this difficult time of war in our country. The funds raised for us were wisely spent on various projects, such as: purchased flour for baking bread for internally displaced persons who are displaced in the city, food packages that can provide a family (3-4 people) per week, things and necessities - many families were forced to leave their homes only with documents, without clothes and hygiene products, evacuation assistance and resettlement, etc. Our Lord God, a merciful Samaritan who bandages the needy, your sacrifices have given and will enable many more people.

We would like to thank the Management and the entire Samaritan's Bag team for their financial assistance. From the very beginning of the war, we began active work to help the population of Severodonetsk with food and necessary things. Our church stopped in Chernivtsi, where later we evacuated dozens of women, children and everyone who needed it. A huge help was the finances that came at our disposal to cover these needs. And of course, the children of our church were not left without sweets, and the sisters were not left without attention. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, God bless you.

From February 27 to the present day, Vistka Miru Church receives on a permanent basis 70 IDPs from the eastern, northern and southern regions of Ukraine, 25 of them on the territory of the church, 45 are housed in the families of church members. We also provide support to those migrants who are in transit to Western Europe and live with us for 1-2 days. We work with local authorities to support IDPs living in our community. People living in the church and in the families of church members have a full meal at the expense of the church, we provide food aid to refugees living in the community. It costs about $ 5 a day (including utilities) to keep one settler in the church and in the families of church members. Our church Vistka Miru cannot allocate such funds on its own, so we are grateful to all the benefactors who support us. Your contribution is very valuable to us and we truly thank you for your help!

We thanked all the migrants we were able to reach with these funds. But I will remember this woman for a long time. I gave her family money to pay off the utility debt, she was not at home then. And so, a few days later, she comes to me after the service and cries, thanking me for my care, for my blessing, for those who see the need and support. I hugged her for a long time and thanked God. I thank the Mission for its resources. It is difficult for me to put into words how much these funds have supported us, how much we feed and clothe them, warm people who have lost everything. GOD BLESS the generous hearts of those who organized this for us!

<p>
During the war, the Bethel Church in the Khmelnytsky region faced a number of challenges and, at the same time, opportunities in witnessing to the Gospel. Thank you very much for your financial assistance, which has helped to serve different categories of people and different forms of evangelism. Since the beginning of the war and until now, our city has been receiving people from hot spots (currently 3,200 people are registered in Slavuta), some of whom live in the dormitory of the technical lyceum. We have repeatedly provided food, hygiene, clothing and footwear that could not be purchased by ourselves. 120 people live in the dormitory around the clock. One day when we came, we heard an incredible noise. As it turned out, this is how the old washing machine worked, because the other one broke. People evacuating from hotspots were horrified by these sounds every time. So we decided to buy a washing machine and bless the people who live there. People were very grateful. It was just being installed, and the queue for washing was already being sought. Thank God for this opportunity to show God's love in action. We also hold meetings with children and youth of internally displaced persons both in the lyceum dormitory and in the church premises (some children began to take the course "The Greatest Journey" and received notebooks). We thank the Lord for building a relationship with them and for the opportunity to preach the gospel. Holding various evangelistic meetings for immigrants, a number of funds are spent on delicacies. Also looking at the pain and tears of these people, we tried to make pleasant surprises for them, for example, congratulations on their birthdays and made them a little holiday. It's sad to hear their stories. After all, many young people come from families in difficult life circumstances, and some from boarding schools. That is why they are so in need of God's healing. Searching for housing and resettlement, purchasing medicines, transporting humanitarian aid for IDPs and the local hospital, SJO families, as well as for people living in Kyiv region, serving IDPs through a social hub - all this became part of the life of the local church "Bethel ». We also continued to serve as a church for SJO families and families of boarding school graduates in our city and district. Every time we wonder how the Lord works in the village of Berezdov (where the children used to take the course "The Greatest Journey"), because at the Bible study meeting, the number of people and children increases every time. We no longer fit in the house of one of the families, and we pray for the room. During the two months since the beginning of the war, food packages have been repeatedly provided to those who come to these meetings and other humanitarian aid. You would see the reaction of the children at the inn (some people take candy home from the table for the father who abuses alcohol, but the children love it and sing Christian songs at home). We believe that the Lord changes and heals the hearts of everyone who comes. We rejoice when we hear that adults and children are asking for Bibles for them, and they are trying to change their lives. The Lord gives the opportunity through the Samaritan Bag to serve hundreds of people and to proclaim the Good News. On Easter holidays, we hold thematic meetings through various forms of evangelism: - visiting families of Sjo, migrants with food packages and sweet rolls (Easter cakes). One of the testimonies. When we arrived at the SJO family, which has 4 children, the father was drunk. We blessed them with a food package, sweets and the little one immediately grabbed these treats. In a dirty hut, a frowning baby, but smiling from the fact that she received sweets and Easter bread. And we were glad that we could pray together with parents and children and give a little holiday to this family; - youth meetings, where there are migrants, boarding school graduates, young people from the city and young people from crisis families; - general church meetings attended by immigrants, to whom we helped and preached the Word of God (young people have already joined in glorifying the Lord by singing); - watching a movie and communicating at a festive table with internally displaced persons, etc. And all this is possible thanks to you, dear brothers and sisters! Thank you very much! We have a few more ministry projects that will also be funded by the Samaritan Bag. Therefore, we truly thank you for the resource that serves to expand God's kingdom on earth.

Thanks to funds from the Samaritan's Bag, our community was able to support the victims of the war. Members of our community sheltered about 20 families (50 people) at home. Most of them will stay here for a long time, because their homes have been destroyed and cities have been mined. All IDPs receive food kits and basic necessities from the community. Our region is far from fighting, so people have the opportunity to relax physically and emotionally, as well as to be reborn spiritually, as most of the migrants attend services for the first time. Thanks to help from the Samaritan's Bag, we were able to purchase a refrigerator and a washing machine to provide shelter for the settlers right in the house of prayer. Later, we will be able to accommodate at least 6 families in the church. Also, thanks to the Samaritan's Bag, we were able to pay for our volunteers, who repeatedly took humanitarian aid to hot spots in our country and took people out. Since the war is not over, we still have work plans. We truly thank you for your generous assistance to our community during the war. This is a tangible help. May the Lord bless every person who has donated to this project and give you a peaceful sky

On behalf of the staff of the Center for Inspiration (Shepetivka, Khmelnytsky region), we express our sincere gratitude for the generous financial assistance provided during the martial law in the country. The war has radically changed the direction of our ministry, but we still manage to keep our slogan - LOVE, PRAY, HELP! We praise God that we embody these verbs together with you! Thanks to your financial donation, we were able to invest it to help displaced people, as well as local families with many children, those in difficult circumstances, and low-income families in rural areas. Currently, the Inspiration Center is home to 46 people (including children) who receive 3 meals a day, as well as the possibility of hot water, washing machine, cozy and warm rooms. This ministry is costly, but we see God's faithfulness and your love in action. We could also buy ingredients and bake 100 Easter cakes with the settlers and visit the families of the settlers and local low-income families before the resurrection of Christ, congratulating them - share the Good News and invite them to the service! There was so much happiness and tears of joy in their eyes, kissing a homemade bun in their hands, thank you! Part of the funds was invested in the repair of the bead, namely - the replacement of 4 injectors. This car served a lot in hot spots, where it delivered food and various humanitarian aid, and on the way back evacuated people (mostly women with children). The Lord also gives us to continue working in the countryside with those families to whom we have preached the Word of God before. People are now even more open, and they ask for the Bible themselves, constantly come to Scripture meetings, and invite their loved ones. Thanks to you, we were able to purchase food packages and bless them at such a difficult time today. We continue to love these people, pray for them and help everyone we can with one desire - to show them Christ and bring them to Christ! For the glorification of His Holy Name!

The Voice of the Gospel Church sincerely thanks the Samaritan Bag Mission for its financial assistance. The funds received helped us to provide shelter for people fleeing the war (accommodation, meals). Also during this period, we organize free lunches for refugees who have stopped in our city and attend church services. For families who have found temporary housing in our city, we help with products. The funds have not yet been used in full. We plan to hold evangelistic meetings with children during the holidays. The Church is currently working on arranging living rooms and showers so that the Church can provide housing for the needy.

Church of Pillars is grateful for the financial assistance received from the "Christmas Child" project. Thanks to your support, fifteen families have been constantly assisting with everything they need for two months. These are refugee families, large families, SJO children, orphans and semi-orphans. Part of the support was spent on helping families evacuated from Kyiv to provide accommodation and meals. They were able to resume the children's ministry and three times a week the children can come to church and have a fresh and hot lunch. Elderly people also had the opportunity to receive food packages as well as medicines. These funds were also used for transportation costs. Since in the village where for some time there were no products and medicines, and local transport did not work, so you need to help with the purchase and delivery of it. We truly thank you for the care and blessings that enable others to feel God's care and support in these difficult times of trial. Blessings to you !!!

<p>
Thank you sincerely for providing an opportunity to support people in need, people who are in difficult life circumstances. We have helped many families of IDPs who have taken refuge in Shumsk. We were able to cover the costs of transportation, food, medicine and personal hygiene products. In those conditions, people try to somehow create comfort and living conditions. Every story is impressive. I think a book of dramatic stories will be written someday. Many people who received help with tears in their eyes thanked. They did not expect such a display of kindness and warmth. Most of the families where we were helping at this time, men either returned to the outskirts of Kiev to dismantle the destruction of their own homes, or went to work to provide for their families. One story was particularly striking. We arrived at a house in the suburbs of Shumsk where three families of refugees from Irpin lived. They showed photos of destroyed houses. It hurts to watch when people just entered a new home and only the surviving aquarium remained, everything else burned out (I'll add it in poor quality because I took a photo from their phone). There were also many single older women who did not know how to live. Will they have enough pensions, for life, or their whole house? They do not know how their houses survived or survived. Together we became for them the hands of the dope, the hands of Christ. In such a difficult time, the church must serve the people by doing good. "Luke 10:27 And he answered and said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself." Thank God for you! Together we have become collaborators for the service of the Ukrainian people!

My name is Tamara. We left Kherson. They were forced to leave everything, the apartment and the apartment, which is 20 years old, was arranged. Because that's how they occupied our city. Explosions, constant automatic queues follow us. We did not go out for two weeks to make cakes for ourselves, bread, the child was without milk, without anything. It was so scary, because our house is prefabricated. And here even nearby somewhere something explodes. In the apartment, in a room couldn't sleep on a bed because we were afraid, the panel house, and all of us there will kill. We lived in a corridor. At first they did not go to the store, but then they were forced to leave. In the shops there are few products, everything is expensive, sugar 150 hryvnias, pasta 400 grams 150 hryvnias. People started coming to the bazaar from the districts, then they went for milk and potatoes, but there were racists around. We go to the market and they are between us. Wrongly looked up, warning. We went to rallies, we all went. That's where our guys got on the armored personnel carrier, shouted "Kherson is Ukraine", "home", "Guys, you don't need to be here". They weren't afraid of them at once, but when their black uniform, like riot police, came to us, they started shooting at us. They started throwing checkers, after that they became afraid and didn't come. People began to leave, almost 40% at that time left the city. Because it is impossible for them to climb, steal, threaten. Here comes directly to the entrance, go to the roof carrying some things, boxes. Our guys, who can go down, scratched the roofs. We went through the lists, looking for who was in the anti-terrorist operation. Daily automatic queues in the morning, afternoon and evening. In our yard, a car was fired upon, and a civilian boy was killed nearby. We have near Chornobaivka, the airport. Constant explosions. The little granddaughter did not walk outside, nowhere. For the sake of grandchildren decided to leave, contacted volunteers and took us, Thank God. We passed 12 Russian posts. We are elderly, few people are interested, and young people were undressed, looking for tattoos, it was scary. We finally managed to leave. We are currently in Uzhhorod, grateful to the Morning Star Charitable Foundation for accepting us, providing us with food, housing, medicine and helping everyone in need. I am glad that we can all be together with our family. My name is Anastasia, we lived in Donetsk region, Druzhkivka. On February 24, our lives changed dramatically, at half past four in the morning a fragmentation rocket flew at us and passed through metal and wood. Waking up from the tremor of the house, not understanding what was happening, half a minute later the rocket fell, from the explosion and fright, the children went down to the basement with children in not understanding the scream, undressing only in shorts, now not summer but frost on the street. The only thing that saved us was that we had a car, we left home that day and the ordeal of fate began here. We left the city for 70 kilometers, we were given a house, but there was no basement or shelter. The explosions hit very close, scratched the windows, rockets flew over the house, begged God to pass us. So we lived for over a month. We decided to evacuate. I feared for the lives of my children. We arrived in Uzhgorod. We were received by the Morning Star Charitable Foundation. The head of the foundation gave us housing where we now live and provides us with food, medicine and everything we need. I am grateful to God, the Morning Star Foundation for help.

Evangelical Baptist Church "NEW LIFE"
</h2>
<h3>

<p>
From the very beginning of the war, on February 24, our NEW LIFE Church and my family began to host people whom everyone later began to call "IDPs." For the first two weeks of each day we received 5 to 15 people at home, there were a lot of small children. Mostly, they were our friends and acquaintances from other cities: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, Mariupol. Then their friends and acquaintances came to us, with whom we were not acquainted, but the Lord introduced us in this way. In total, more than 80 people passed through our church during these four weeks of these sad events. We stopped not only in our house, but also in the houses of our church members. Even some of my neighbors - my unbelieving neighbor Oleg, a 50-year-old man - open their homes to such people. In addition to transit travelers, we also try to help those people who came to our neighborhood Kropyvnytskyi and settled here for a while, from other major cities in Ukraine - who are fleeing the war, but still unable to go further. Yes, the other day we met a young woman - Valentina. Valentina (mother, 30 years old) and her two children - daughter Veronica (10 years old) and son Vladislav (7 months old) were forced to leave their hometown due to heavy shelling. Valentina's family from Chernihiv and this city is now in a very difficult situation: constant rocket fire on buildings. The young woman says that the school and kindergarten in their area have already been destroyed, as well as some houses, no water and heating, and almost no grocery stores. Valentina left with the children, and her husband stayed at home to look after their apartment. At the moment, it is very difficult to leave such cities, because there is shelling all the time and there are no green corridors. We have to go on field roads. With God's help, they got to Kropyvnytskyi and settled here with Olga's wives (according to the state program to support IDPs). Our church, maintaining good relations with the municipal authorities, learned about this family and visited them the other day. We gave them food, children's toys, stationery, hygiene items, Christian literature. Our daughter Marina talked a little with Valentina and her daughter Veronica. We ask you to pray for such families, of which there are hundreds of thousands in Ukraine today. With all our hearts we, the Evangelical Church "NEW LIFE" New city Kropyvnytskyi, Kirovohrad region, we express our sincere gratitude to all those who supported us prayerfully and financially in this difficult time for all of Ukraine. We pray to the Lord God to bless everyone with His Peace and Grace! We pray that through this care and help of our people, the Merciful God Jesus Christ will be revealed to people so that they may seek and find Him as their Personal Savior and Lord. Glory and Gratitude to him for everything! Sincerely, Serhiy Teslenko, Pastor of the New Life Church

<p>
Greetings! Every morning, we invite about 60 unbelievers to church. For an hour, we speak the Word of God with them, pray, distribute food packages. We cover about 350 people per week. On average, one food package, per person, per week. A list of recipients is maintained. As a pastor, I note that physical (grocery) help makes spiritual changes in people. Of those who started going to church after the war, more than 200 prayed for the first time. More than 50 people repented. Preparing for baptism, 12 people. God through the temporal, makes the eternal! May the Lord richly bless you and your families and reward you for the help you have given to our church and made this service possible!

<p>
We truly thank you that together with the church we can help more than 60 refugees who are left in need, and people who are in difficult life circumstances in the region of the village of Verba. We are able to cover transportation costs, and provide food, medicine, personal hygiene products and office supplies. Many people who received help with tears in their eyes thanked. They did not expect such a display of kindness and warmth. People try to adapt to rural conditions, but somehow create comfort and living conditions.

<p>
Our church is located in the city of Vinnytsia and we can say that it is the central part of the country. It is about 350 km from Kyiv, and the main road to the west, to the border, passes through Vinnytsia. Therefore, literally from the first day of the war, as soon as we recovered and realized that we were less safe, but could help others, we volunteered. The church has a large room, a spacious dining room, rooms for children and a small hotel for 30 people. such conditions made it possible to receive up to 150 people for a temporary stay every day. these people. They were taken in for the night, fed, clothed, provided with necessities, transported to safer places for further residence, and organized trips to the border. People frightened, anxious, exhausted and upset for the first time in their lives came to the church. At first they look at us with suspicion, but after a warm welcome - their faces brighten and so it happens with almost everyone who came. When these people leave the church, they hug the team members, kiss, thank and thank them for the care and love shown to them and the feeling that in these few days, they become relatives. People want to give something in memory to those who cared about them: flowers, some trinkets, children draw pictures of gratitude, but most importantly, people are interested in what kind of church it is and want to know more about it. We exchange telephone numbers, give spiritual literature and prayerfully send our migrants on their way, hoping that the time spent with us will be in vain for them. Some who remain in the city are also willing to help with volunteering, and today more than 10 people have joined the volunteer team and are helping out at the church's social center, which is open 5 days a week, delivering food and holding activities for children with disabilities. disabled people who have moved to our city and for adults.

There are 47 refugees from the east and south of Ukraine living within our parish. We are doing our best to help the seven pits who were forced to leave their homes due to the war. We offer a helping hand to everything we can: food, personal hygiene products, clothing and medicine. They also bought and sent medicine to treat wounded defenders of our country. We want to witness the history of one family that moved to us from Kharkiv region. Mom and children got to us by bus, so they had few things with them. The woman was advised to turn to the Church for help. So seven, this is almost the first time I have entered the service of God in the Ukrainian Church, where all prayers are clear, because they are spoken in Ukrainian, and almost the entire service the woman cried. And after the service she could not thank the priest, because she had not heard such sermons yet. Of course, they received financial aid (from the funds that your organization transferred to us) and bought clothes and essentials for themselves and their children. Now seven, I come to church every Sunday and the children's mother jokes that the shoes and hat for her daughter turned out to be their way to God. Our parish will continue to help those in need. We are currently developing new food kits (from products that have a long shelf life: cereals, flour, sugar, canned food, tea, coffee, etc.) for refugee families.

We truly thank Samaritan's Purse for their help! As a representative of the EHB Church in Yakymivka, I would like to sincerely thank you for your support during the war. Our church organized assistance in evacuating people from combat cities, we made coffee, tea, baked pies, pizzas, made sandwiches, and sweets. We provided assistance to refugees in the form of food kits, hygiene products for families in difficult life circumstances. We also provided assistance to children with disabilities who needed medical treatment and the necessary facilities for them. By helping in this difficult time for all of us, you are not just giving material values, but you are hoping that together we will overcome any difficulties. Thank you once again for your support and for your sincere and sensitive hearts. Because you do not stand aside from the problems of ordinary people. May your kindness and generosity return to you a hundredfold. We wish you all the best and prosperity. May God send you good health, joy and happiness! May God bless you!

Thanks to your funds, we have purchased products to help internally displaced persons in Cherkasy and Cherkasy region, and all those who are in transit to the cities of Western Ukraine and Europe. Today in the Cherkasy region there are about 100 thousand people from the regions of the country where hostilities are taking place. People are in dire need of food, hygiene products, household chemicals, essential medicines, blankets, mattresses, pillows, clothing and housing. Thanks to your donations, we have already helped about 1,000 people who have sought food, medicine and resettlement assistance. Everyone who asked for help received not only food aid but also moral and spiritual support, and people heard the gospel. As a result, about 60 people joined the church. Immigrants are grateful for their care, shelter, help and moral support. We continue to help new people and take care of new people who are adapting in Cherkasy. Many immigrants visited the Protestant church for the first time. In addition, we evacuated 40 people (women and children) fleeing the war zone to the border with Poland and then to Sweden. THANK YOU VERY MUCH for your help! May God bless you abundantly!

Thank God and the Samaritan Bag Mission for timely assistance. The provided finances serve people in the villages of Kalynivka, Voskresensk, Peresadivka, Gorokhivka, M. Pohorilove both believers and non-believers. We bought medicines for the majority of people in Lviv and transported them to Mykolayiv region. During the month, church volunteers helped about 100 families and not once but systematically resumed supplies as products ran out. Due to the fighting, many families were left without income, without official work and without financial assistance from the state, many people were left alone in need. There was a case when a young family's young child began to lose weight because there was a lack of normal food and thank God we have the opportunity to serve this family and today they are provided with normal baby food, hygiene products. There was also a big problem with diapers for children and bedridden patients, we have more than 10 of them and today both patients and children in our area are provided with diapers. Helped inhabitants of Nikolaev with drinking water, to pay to some for housing and communal services, bought for volunteers gasoline for transportation of people to safe places for delivery of products. We continue to serve our people and are sincerely grateful to our friends for their material help, may Almighty God reward you for your sacrifice and love!

<p>
Congratulations, Glory be to our Savior Jesus Christ! My name is Eugene, I am the pastor of the Church of Salvation in Blagoveshchensk, Kirovohrad region. For several years we have been cooperating with the Samaritan Bag, giving joy to children and serving them to spread the Good News. Unexpectedly, a terrible war broke out in my Ukraine ? From the first days, we help people as much as we can - we share our food, warm things, help with transport, we serve prayer and consolation at services. Therefore, your financial support has been a great blessing for us, and I am even more convinced of the unity of Christ's Church! Therefore, they received this blessing as from the hands of Jesus Christ Himself! We have decided by our Church Council that part of the funds will be as financial aid for each family of our community (because someone went to safe cities - you need to pay for travel, someone needs medicine, some lost their jobs and no money to live…), the second part was spent for food packages and household chemicals - we gladly distributed them to needy people, came to their homes, prayed for them, talked. More than 100 families are immigrants from war-torn cities, wives whose husbands are defending their homeland at the front, these are poor families, single mothers with many children, and Roma families. People not only received food, but also heard about the Love of Christ, we prayed for them. From the whole community of our Christian Church "Salvation", the city of the Annunciation - I sincerely thank each of you, for your prayers, for support and word and material. “1 John 4:21. And this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should love his brother also. " We pray for you and your service to the Lord! I wish peace to all of us! (several photos of meetings with people who received help)

During the time we received the funds, we were able to help 20 families with grocery kits and other necessities. The vast majority of these families are immigrants. As from the Kharkiv, Kiev and Nikolaev areas. They also had the opportunity to help refugee children with whom volunteers work in the day center at the local Novoushitsky Music School. This day center hosts various clubs, drawing, art, singing and more. For them we had the opportunity to organize tea, coffee, cookies and had the opportunity to communicate and spread the Word of God.

The Dorcas EEZ Charitable Foundation used the financial aid received from Samaritans Purse to make food for migrants in various villages and towns. In the village of Surte, 48 migrants have lived in the kindergarten since the beginning of the war, the kindergarten received various equipment, utensils, a microwave oven, and a dryer, which they could not buy. In the city of Uzhgorod, the Blago Foundation constantly receives migrants, they bought a refrigerator, gas stove and various pots for them. In the village of V. Dobron, hot food is prepared daily for 500 migrants twice a day. They needed an industrial dishwasher, and most of the money was spent on it. Our fund also received food from Romania and part of the proceeds was used to transport food to various settlements where migrants live. The help is very useful, we are grateful for everything. Blessings for your work!

<p>
On behalf of our church, we would like to sincerely thank the staff of the Samaritan Bag for providing us with financial assistance. We use the funds we received to support the migrants who stay with us. We provide them with food, medicine, and transport to meet their needs. We also help those who need it with finances. We pay for utilities. We have a small church, but everyone sincerely prays and asks God for mercy on our people. Our pastor was also taken from us to the army (he is our organizer of the assistance we provide to IDPs). Now for our little church it is an experience, but we hope for the mercy of God, who knows everything. This does not stop us from continuing to help and serve the cause of God

The funds we received from the Samaritan's Bag charity were used to support the temporarily displaced. For food, personal hygiene products and everything necessary for life. We sheltered 44 people directly in our church, and some families from our church took in people fleeing the horror. In total, the church received 100 people. Also, thanks to these funds, we can feed people in hot spots who do not have access to food. The funds were sent to help people who do not have access to leave the city. For burning to transport small trucks products for starving people and children living in basements and bomb shelters. We truly thank you for your financial assistance, which is very important today. May God bless you all and your ministry.

The funds provided to us by the Samaritan Bag were extremely important and necessary help for us in this difficult time. Our community is sincerely grateful for this opportunity to receive financial assistance to support internally displaced persons. for its further transportation to the regions, fighting is currently underway (information on volunteer financial support for men working in warehouses is maintained on a weekly basis). In addition, with the funds allocated by the Samaritan's Bag, we can purchase food for the refugee camp on the basis of our community 4. But there is another great need, which, unfortunately, is not enough - the replacement of windows in the church. After all, the windows are old, rotting in places and because of this there are drafts, moisture, etc. We want to expand the refugee camp and increase their number in our community, but for this we need to make this repair - replacement of windows

Factories and many enterprises have stopped in our city, many people have lost their jobs. There are many large families and orphans in our church. Thanks to funds from the Samaritan's Bag, food, medicine, and diapers for children were purchased. Also, part of the funds went to treat a man who was injured in a collision in his car with a tank. His mother died on the spot, the man himself was taken to hospital with injuries. We are very grateful to God and not indifferent people who help us in this difficult time for Ukraine! May the Lord protect all and give peace!

Having received funds from the Samaritan Bag, we purchased products for people who moved from the occupied areas. They also helped financially to purchase hygiene and clothing for people who fled the shelling and had nothing with them. There were also people in need, especially children and women. Every action that has been taken for those who need help is sincerely grateful for the help. Maybe not everything can be described in words or fixed in files, but this is a great help for us. May God bless you for your work and sincerity.

<p>
These days, our church, like many other churches in Ukraine, is trying by all possible means to serve those who need it most. The church constantly accepts people who have been forced to leave their homes and are fleeing the war. The church premises became a shelter, a place where you can eat, rest, get other necessary help, hear the Gospel, pray to the Lord together. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the Church has received more than a thousand people, which we continue to do to this day. Also, every week we send a minibus to the east of our country with humanitarian aid: food, personal hygiene products. A brother from our church is returning with people who have left their homes in the war zones. Thank you for your financial assistance, which you provided for the needs of internally displaced persons, they were used to help Ukrainians who suffered from the military actions of the Russian Federation against our people.

During the war, our church joined in actively helping people affected by the war - the evacuation of the population from hot spots, evangelism, pastoral care of refugees, transportation and distribution of humanitarian aid to the needy. Our brothers arrived in Kramatorsk on April 9, the day after the tragedy at the train station. People were very scared, they didn't know where to go - where it would be safe and where they would be received. The brothers testified to them about God's protection, protection, and care and offered to pray together and trust God. Alina and her son Maksym received prayer housing in Western Ukraine. We have a relationship with them - we pray together for their work and income in a new place. The Lord shows His mercy and people in this difficult period of their lives decide to serve God and study His Word.

From the first days of the war, the CEE Church of Bethany was actively involved in providing assistance to temporary migrants, as well as to people who were or are being fought. Hotel rooms and Sunday school classes were designated to accommodate temporarily displaced people who were fed three times a day. At the same time, whole groups of people came through Lviv, stopped for lunch at the church and went on. Young people at the station met people with hot dishes. This is a great experience. A lot of people were taken to the border before the pedestrian crossing !! But thank God that the Samaritan's Bag provided very timely help in a very timely manner !! Nobody could even hope for that !! When they saw the amount of help, they thanked God very much and blessed the Samaritan's Bag !!!!! The funds arrived in time to serve many in need! People cried and thanked us and God for their help in the church. The funds were used to purchase food, pillows, bedding, fuel for the constant transportation of the needy from the station to the border. May the Lord bless the donors and give a hundred !!!.

<p>
Mukachevo Charitable Foundation "Rock" expresses its sincere gratitude for the financial support for Ukraine in difficult times for us. We were able to use these funds for temporarily displaced persons: accommodation and food - 100 people, the formation and distribution of five hundred food packages for families who applied to our fund. Without your support, we would not be able to reach such a large number of people. Thank you very much for the manifestation of God's love !!! Testimony: During the distribution of food packages, the team constantly told people about God's love and invited them to the Church. Many people learned about us and some have already come to worship. We keep in touch and pray for them. People are now open to God's Word! We believe that through our joint work God is glorified, and our local church in Mukachevo "New Creation" will multiply.

Praise the Lord for the support of the Samaritan Bag! Thank you very much for your mercy to the people of Ukraine and for the financial support of our joint Service in April! Thanks to these finances, our team fed people on the street, we rented several apartments for refugees, and there was also a fully functioning refugee reception center at vul. Stepana Bandera, 26. Many people from Sumy, Kyiv, Pokrovsk, Nikolaev, Mariupol, Slavyansk, Ternivka, and Malyn, Chernihiv and other cities passed here in a month. We helped the refugees with food kits, fed them and helped everyone needed for a full life! Some people started going to church, they started living in peace again! Now also in the reception center live orphans who could not leave the shelling for 2 weeks, now, thank God, they are safe. We also started a small school for preschoolers, it's also IDPs. I PLEASE PLEASE SUPPORT OUR FINANCIAL SERVICE IN MAY! PRAY AND BLESS YOU! ??

Thank you very much for your financial help. Our church "Bethany" Although large and few members. Therefore, the assistance has become very supportive. The war broke out and the pastor decided to receive the settlers. Since the hall is large and can accommodate up to 50 people. Preparations began, toilets and showers were completed. They equipped the hall with beds, bought dishes, a refrigerator, an electric stove, and microwaves. A table of love was prepared for Easter. People of different ages and denominations sat at the table and talked like one big family. Because God is our father. Sunday school with presents was prepared for the children. Houses were found for some families. At the expense of the fund cosmetic repairs were carried out. Thanks for support. God's words of the word.

Peace to you brothers and sisters. It was a much-needed aid, we distributed UAH 1,000 per person to all refugees in our district, and purchased food for those who prepare food for the Armed Forces. People were very happy with the financial help because there are many different things about humanitarian aid, such as underwear, hygiene, and so on. In one family and there are seven of them, they were given a house to live in and some food. But when we came to them, they cried because just that day the finances and products they were given for the first time ran out, they said that God heard their prayers. And there are many such stories. Thank God that we can help and serve each other in this way

In connection with the active hostilities that have been taking place in Ukraine since February 24, 2022, from the first days of the war we began to provide assistance to those who were evacuated to temporary residence in Lviv - free accommodation in apartments (37 apartments in general at different times were involved in receiving those who were expelled from their homes by the war, we currently have 64 IDPs); residence during the war in the village of Honchary, Lviv region, Fazenda complex in Honchary, where 65 to 80 people live (some of them from the church of Philadelphia Irpin, a family from Bucha, Brovary, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Vorzel, Kherson, Odessa, Kiev, Chernihiv is our geography). A special moment was when on the 10th day of the war, a woman arrived with a child who was 10 days old. The heart was especially pounding when looking for everything for newborns. And now two mothers with children born during the war have received shelter at the Hacienda. People from different parts of Ukraine, who so often went into obscurity, called or wrote and the moment when you write to them "yes, we have a place to accommodate you, come, relatives, we are waiting" - it struck everyone with love. Many who wrote "are waiting for us - it's so important to hear now, thank you." We provide food for those who live with us and do everything possible so that they do not feel like refugees, but simply feel that they came to their relatives for a short time, that they are happy here, that they are not alone in a terrible war! We also help those who are in the "hot" spots of our country. In particular, in Kharkiv, namely in the city bomb shelter BC "HEMZ", where a team of volunteers of our friends, with whom he served in peacetime in Christian camps for children, came up with various programs, stayed and served people in Kharkov and Kharkiv region, as well feed 150 soldiers of the Armed Forces. This is a miracle, when on the territory leased in peacetime by the church, there is now a city bomb shelter on 1450 sq.m. They are incredibly grateful to everyone who helps and every story matters, because it's someone's life. With their help, they bring people hope, as I often read, when people wonder why young people did not go, but older people take care of them. They understand that they are not alone, because help comes from different parts of Ukraine. It is unbelievable when my grandmother, who has been smiling for 101 years and said that we have a future, is also thanks to help. That's why we are happy to try to gather everything that is necessary for the people there and take them to Kharkiv. Help in Irpin, for those who are there now has become a special moment for us, because now they are our friends, we certainly do not know everyone, but together with those who live with us from Irpin we care for everyone. Realizing that cooking there is still difficult, the love that fills the heart suggested the option - to cook here and bring ready-made food that is only worth warming up or you can taste it anyway. And so it turned out that now we buy food here, prepare delicacies and take our Irpinians to Irpin. Thanks to the financial help you have provided, we can continue to help, worry, show Love. One woman, Luba, who is currently in the Netherlands, sent a message today: “Thank you. As I remember myself at the dark train station in Kyiv ……… ..sirens, it is impossible to get on the train …… .. you revealed God to me ».” I am infinitely grateful that we can serve together with the Samaritan Bag both in peacetime and in wartime !!!! We continue to reveal Christ !!!! I want to say to everyone who has joined this help: Your service in every life brings the hope that is so necessary to live !!!

The church has become a home for many families, where they have been able to feel the warmth, God's support, and His Holy Word. May the Lord sincerely bless you and multiply you a hundredfold.

At this difficult time, we as a community have taken care of several large families in difficult economic situations. One such family has nine people (Seven children), they need almost everything, because they do not have a stable and sufficient source of funding. Also, our community regularly collects and sends humanitarian aid to areas where hostilities are taking place and trying respond to the needs of people affected by the aggressor. We try to meet the needs of the local population, especially the most vulnerable. We support the elderly, single women with children, and all those who are limited in vital things, especially food and medicine. We organize lunches, prepare lunches for territorial defense, provide psychological assistance (We have a Christian psychologist) to all who need it, accept refugees for overnight stays, and help with the resettlement of temporarily displaced people.

This assistance was like a breath of fresh air that freed our hands in providing assistance and completing work for IDPs. We have the necessary resources to enable us to address important issues related to the provision of humanitarian assistance to people in difficult circumstances. She assisted in resolving a number of issues on the delivery of aid to the cities: Kharkiv, Kyiv, Bucha, Dnipro, Sloviansk, Kramatorsk. Thanks to her, we were able to provide assistance to internally displaced persons and arrange places for their detention in Uzhgorod (which housed 30 to 40 people at a time every day). We have people from: Slavyansk, Kharkiv, Irpen, Bucha, Kyiv, K. Roga, Kramatorsk and other places. Thank God for the resource you have given us. Thank you very much for expressing your desire to provide such a necessary resource for working with migrants. We wish you God's blessings and a peaceful sky above your head.

At this difficult time for our country, God has given our church the opportunity to take part in helping people, namely refugees, those who are suffering as a result of hostilities in Ukraine. During this period, in recent weeks, we have been able to communicate with many people. We gave them the news of Jesus Christ and also helped. We helped these people to buy medicine, hand over hygiene items, prepare food, buy and hand over food, buy air mattresses, and create living and heating conditions. This service to disadvantaged, needy people filled our hearts with pain, compassion, and the joy of being able to serve them. The people we personally received, accommodated and supported came from different regions of Ukraine: from Mariupol (Donetsk region), from Zhytomyr, from Kherson, from Kyiv, from Luhansk, from Dnipropetrovsk regions. Here are some testimonies from the people we helped: A resident of Mariupol: “We left two families in two cars, nine of us, including seven women and small children. When we left the city was surrounded, we were already leaving through Russian checkpoints. We tried to ride in a column, as lone cars were firing. It was the last day when it was still possible to leave the city. " A resident of Korosten: “When we got in the car and were already driving, a rocket attack on a military unit began. At first we thought that the wheels of our car were firing, but then we realized that shells were exploding nearby. We managed to leave two families, including three women and seven children. " A resident of Kherson region: “We have four young children. When we left the city was already occupied. We had to pass eight Russian checkpoints. We passed two of them, and then we were not allowed. We decided to take a detour by side roads. Thank God we managed to pass. The next day we were told that Russian artillery and tanks were parked near the house where we lived. " A resident of Lysychansk: “We had an apartment and a car. The shelling was every five minutes. We could not leave, we were taken out by the Ukrainian military. We left everything and I don't know what to do next. " A boy from eastern Ukraine: "A rocket exploded near our house, but we survived." During our meeting with refugee children from Vasylkiv (Kyiv region), it started to rain and thunder began to thunder. The children were very scared because it reminded them of war. We reassured these children, saying that they are now in a safe place and we will take care of them. In recent weeks, we have provided various assistance to 220 people, including 165 of them children aged 2 months to 17 years. We also held prayer meetings with them, and conducted Bible lessons for the children, handed out gifts, and treated them using the resources of the Samaritan Bag. These people, whom we helped, live in our house, in the church, in the apartment in private houses, in the premises of kindergartens, schools. They still need help. We want to serve them by providing spiritual and physical support, because it is such a blessing to show mercy to them as Jesus Christ shows mercy to us. Also, the people we helped come and still want to come to our church for worship. At this time, we would like to express our special, sincere gratitude to the staff of the Samaritan Bag Mission from all those children who have thanked many times for their help, as well as from their parents. Also, accept from our church sincere, fraternal gratitude for your support, for this blessed opportunity, opened through you, to serve disadvantaged people. With respect and gratitude to you pastor of the church EHB with. Nove Selo, Zakarpattia region Vyacheslav Bovsunivsky.

<p>
Dear friends of the Samaritan Bag) Thank our Lord that He is our Hope, Strength and Support ????We live in a difficult time for our country. Thank you very much for your financial support. God unites our hearts for His Glory. Together with you, we can help suffering people who are in dire need of help. , diapers, medicines. They were able to refuel cars to take people left behind to safer places. Many people were taken to the border, people are forced to find a place to survive. We bought food and prepared food and hot tea for the guys who are on duty. We accept and prepare food for migrants from Borodyanka, Luhansk, Donetsk, Gostomel, Kyiv, Belogorodka. Thank God we have a good opportunity to help them feed, nourish, and clothe them. ???? I will give a couple of examples, although you can write many… One couple who came from Borodyanka. A woman in her 60s, when she received help, just started crying with the words: "Don't think, I had a lot of clothes, I had everything, but ran out of the house and came in what is on us, without things without anything .. I'm like that I am grateful to you for these clothes, for these products, thank you for helping me, may God bless you in everything. ”With tears in her eyes, she rejoices and thanks. We put the Bible or the New Testament in each box of food. A little time passed and this woman asked for another Bible, she tells us a lot in the house, we want another one. At such a moment, you especially thank God that we can sow seeds, and God grows. We had an opportunity to refuel cars, to people who wanted to return to the, though shot homes to Kyiv. Without light, without water, but your own. Buy the necessary things for them. Another young family came from Donetsk, when they received a set of food and sweets, toys for children, the following words were heard: "Thank you very much !! We probably would not have been helped in Donetsk." In Matthew 5:14, "You are the light of the world," the wonderful words in the Bible that we can be light on this earth. When you help people in your heart, there is a special gratitude and joy that God sends people to whom we can help and share His immeasurable love. Everyone has their own little mission, someone prays, someone prepares, allocates funds, takes people away, packs and all of us are united by God's love. I believe that the Lord will bless and reward those who work in His land. Thank you very much for helping us financially and we can take care of others! May the Lord bless each of you abundantly. We are happy that we know Him and that we have the One we can turn to and that we have special support. I believe that the Lord will give us a time to meet, if not on earth, then in heaven. The Lord has helped us to this place! (1 Samuel 7:12) With love, brothers and sisters of the Yemilchyn ECB.

The Nikolaev association received financial aid. The association is engaged in volunteer activities. We deliver food to churches, which transport it further to the addresses of the needy. Distributed in hospitals, unions, disabled people, Afghans. We also distribute to people who live in the city and its environs. Priority is given to large families, the disabled and the bedridden. The second direction of the association today is the evacuation of people. We are evacuating people who are leaving the occupied territories of Snihurivka and Kherson. At the same time, immigrants sometimes live for several days in a bomb shelter near one of the churches. Established flight logistics. When the water in the city network was turned off, an autonomous system was built in that church. We transport water to the system, as well as to people in high-rise buildings nearby. Most of the finances were used to purchase fuel for transport and to repair trucks.

Looking at the current situation in Ukraine. God always comes to the rescue. To date, many refugees, hundreds, have passed through our Church. Now there are 12 families who have remained with us. And it is about 100 people including the majority of children. And most of them have nowhere to go. But thanks to Bose for the mission "Samaritan's Bag" which helped financially. We could hug them, feed them and settle them. To make them feel warm and cozy. But we still need to continue working to continue accepting new refugees. Now there are from Donetsk, Kherson, Kyiv region, and Chernihiv, Luhansk.

<p>
Congratulations, dear employees of the "Samaritan's Bag", thank you for the funds we received for our even more fruitful service to the people. This is a very difficult time for our country and our people, especially the elderly and young children. We were amazed at how many elderly people were left alone, because their guardians or those who cared for them just left and they were left alone with their problems. and needs. With the funds we receive, we buy products, medicines and form "help" packages. If it is a family where the children are small alone. for the elderly a little second products and medicines as needed..In fact, everyone who receives help does not hold back tears and thanks God and us. At this time, people are open to hearing the Word of God and prayer. We are very grateful to all the people for your money. And we will continue to help those who need it. Glory to Jesus Christ.

Funds are used for IDPs to provide for their lives, purchase of washing machines, refrigerators, electric stoves for cooking, we also transfer funds to small communities that have accepted IDPs and can not provide and maintain them. Funds for the purchase of fuel for the delivery of humanitarian aid from the western regions directly to those points where people have to hide in basements, We spend money on fuel for small cars that deliver food and humanitarian aid to the most dangerous places. but there is some opportunity to buy something on the spot, we transfer funds to the bank cards of employees and people in need. At churches we organize holidays for the children of migrants and their parents by giving them gifts and giving them festive dinners. We sing and pray with them, giving them a little happiness and hope in their lives. We truly thank all the sponsors and donors for their participation in the suffering of our people, may the Lord bless you.

Families of migrants from Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Kyiv were received. They helped them financially with housing and utilities. Helped with products. My brother from our church serves in the military in the combat zone, they bought him ammunition. They made a children's Easter program with the children of migrants. We financially help the church from Kharkiv that serves there in the city. Many parcels were sent to our friends who moved from the war zone to other cities in our country. We continue to serve those who need help! Thank God! We thank you! Glory to him!

<p>
Good day! The funds received from the Samaritan's Bag as charitable aid by the Church of Jesus Christ (Bashtanka, Mykolaiv region) were used to purchase food and distributed to needy, affected residents of Bashtanka. Foodstuffs are important, because in the city of Bashtanka, which is on the front line near the city of Mykolayiv, foodstuffs have risen in price, they are imported in limited quantities and dosed "in hand". In addition, at the request of one family from Bashtanka, a house damaged by shelling, in addition to food, purchased hygiene products and household goods. Currently, the work is still ongoing. The rest of the charitable aid will be used to restore the roofs of damaged houses, of which there are many in the Bashtansky district.

<p>
On the morning of February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation, without declaring war, invaded the territory of the sovereign democratic state of Ukraine. Violent bloody battles with the enemy in the territory of our cities inevitably lead to the loss of the inhabitants of Ukraine of their homes, a dignified existence, and even life, but the most terrible thing that can happen in life is the loss of Faith. There are no strangers in Ukraine, there is no place for indifference, in Ukraine there is love for God and neighbor and for one's land. That is why religious, charitable and public organizations of Mukachevo, having no moral and spiritual right to stay away from human tragedies, reaffirming their deep faith in the fundamental truths enshrined in the basic law of our state and in the word of God, taking into account The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was established on the basis of the Sinai Christian Missionary Charitable Center, which belongs to the Resurrection Church of the Evangelical Faith, and the Operational Headquarters for Aid to Victims of Russian Attacks. The purpose of the Operational Headquarters is to provide assistance to victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Thank you very much from the Church of the Resurrection and the Operational Headquarters for Assistance to the Victims of the Russian Attack, for your financial assistance in the amount of $ 5,000. The funds provided by you were used to purchase household appliances, washing machines, dryers, ironing boards, shower boxes, water heaters, washbasins and components, which gave us the opportunity to create extremely good living conditions for temporarily displaced persons. God bless you - let's go together to victory.

The City of Life Church (Uzhhorod, Zakarpattia region) expresses its sincere gratitude to the partners of the Samaritan's Bag charity organization for their financial assistance. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, our church has been helping IDPs who have had to flee their homes. We house people in our homes and in our church. We distribute food, clothing and basic necessities. Many people came in the same clothes without means of subsistence, many have nowhere to return because their homes have been destroyed. So, we give some of the money to people so that they can buy what they need, and we also help pay for utilities. We are infinitely grateful for your kind hearts and much-needed help at this difficult time. We believe in victory. God be with us all. Blessings)

Thanks to funds from the Samaritan Bag, our church was able to provide targeted assistance to affected families from Bucha, Irpin, Kyiv, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Kharkiv regions in the form of products, hygiene products, household chemicals, medicines, etc., which are currently in our city. They also joined the work of local volunteer centers and social services, providing them with products provided to IDPs. We bought a microwave oven in the center, which houses temporarily displaced people. They bought sowing material for Borodyanka and surrounding villages. The sisters of our community have repeatedly baked cakes for the military of the Armed Forces and for the residents of the affected regions. They also took part in organizing the transfer of products and providing fuel to the people of Kharkiv region through our brother in Christ. They joined financially in the construction of a home for refugees from Mariupol. We truly thank everyone who made this help possible! We believe that this has become a manifestation of God's love for those people who at this difficult time are unable to cope with the circumstances alone! May the Lord repay a hundredfold!

For our church, for the people of the city, this is an evidence that God is with us and we are not alone. Families from other cities have food and housing. Families in the church who have lost their jobs have help. We held a children's holiday for refugees and children of the city with a sweet table and gifts. Seven people are close to repentance

Good day. We thank the Samaritan Bag Mission for financial assistance. From the first days of the war, a humanitarian aid headquarters was organized on the basis of the office of our church. Thanks to your help, we are able to help with products, hygiene products, clothes, medicines - internally displaced persons living in schools, kindergartens, dormitories of our city. We also help to find housing for families with children and settle in a new place. Whenever possible, assistance is also transferred to the eastern regions of Ukraine, where there is the greatest need. May the Lord bless you and help us all to go through these difficult times.

During the 60 days of the war, we were able to feed more than 20,000 people with sandwiches at the railway station in Odessa during the evacuation, these people fled from hostilities, sometimes under fire with a backpack on their shoulders, where they had the most necessary documents ... about what to take I didn't even have time to think on the road. But God took care of this through the finances that He gave us. We also visited about 700 families, who received food packages, hygiene products, and household chemicals. Words cannot convey the emotions that people feel. ... They just kiss potatoes in a bag, rejoice in toilet paper. They are immensely happy that they were not left at such a difficult time for them. We sincerely thank you for the finances for the ministry, may the Lord reward a hundredfold who donates resources, time, patience.

From the first days of the war, the church began serving refugees. Sunday school classes were immediately converted into bedrooms. There are 30 refugees living at the church on a permanent basis, and about 20 more spend the night one or two nights and move on. About 70 more live in the homes of church members. The church's kitchen feeds about 50 refugees three times a day. Also, every Sunday we distribute food kits to refugees who do not live in the church. Purchased products and transferred to the Nikolaev and Kherson areas. They took food and distributed it in the villages of Kyiv region after their deoccupation. Several times they bought medicines and transferred them to cities where it is impossible to buy them (Sumy, Svatove, Luhansk region). All this, and much more, the church could do, including with the help of the Christmas Child Project. We truly thank you for spending this difficult time with us!

Thanks to finances, we were able to provide material assistance to refugees from the eastern regions and the Kyiv region. People who were driving towards the border in their cars could get an overnight stay, hot food, showers and medical care, as well as fuel in the form of gasoline or diesel fuel if they did not have it in the tank. Those who temporarily stayed in the Vinnitsa region and the city of Vinnitsa receive weekly and daily hot meals and food packages, as well as personal hygiene items.

With the help of the received funds, the Church of Grace is able to support the families of migrants from the territories where the hostilities are taking place. Food, clothes, necessary things and items were purchased, housing was rented. The story of one family who left the village of Andriyivka, Kyiv region, was especially affected, and a few days later their house was completely destroyed. They have small children, a man with a disability and a blind grandmother. The family was very worried that there were no means and means of subsistence. But thanks to the funds provided, it was possible to help them significantly. There are also meetings with displaced children, communication that helps children make friends, adapt to new conditions. We truly thank the Lord and you, dear partners, for your funds, help and prayerful support. We believe that the Lord will show mercy to Ukraine and Ukrainians. We bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!

We truly thank the Samaritan's Bag project for the gifts, printed materials, and funds we received for the ministry. At such a difficult time for our country, your resources have been a great blessing to many children and their parents. Since the beginning of the war, with God's help, we have been able to conduct several evangelistic events in which we used the resources received from you, namely: - for a group of children with hearing impairments, as well as migrants in the village of Berezivka (Zhytomyr district) and their parents in Zhytomyr - Easter meeting for a group of children in the village of Teterivka (Zhytomyr district). - Evangelistic meeting with children in the village of Vydybir (Chernyakhiv district) We also held many individual meetings with children and provided gifts, brochures and assistance to a group of children from Zhytomyr whose parents are police officers. For them it was a real encouragement and surprise! But the greatest impression of our team was left after visiting several villages liberated from occupation in Makariv, Bucha and Borodyanka districts of Kyiv region (Nemishaevo, Dibrova, Mirotske, Andriyivka, Vablya, Borodyanka). We brought help to the inhabitants of these settlements, who found themselves in difficult circumstances, without water, gas and electricity, and to the children we met, we gave gifts and testified about the Lord. Thanks to the funds received from you, we were able to purchase and distribute medicines to the needy (for pressure, painkillers, vitamins, etc.), various foods, fruits / vegetables, matches, candles, batteries and other essentials. The money was also spent on car fuel. So far, we have been able to reach about 150 children and their parents (families). All children and parents are pleasantly surprised, very grateful! There were tears of gratitude in some of them for the gifts and help. In such a difficult time of war, tension and stress, the resources you have provided have brought many children and adults some comfort, encouragement, and real support. Imagine how in one village we took the fragments of a rocket that the children were playing with from the children's hands and gave them wonderful gifts that were a real blessing for them! In the town of Borodyanka, we stopped at a large crowd of people waiting for charitable help. We called the children with their parents apart and gave them gifts and sweets / fruits, testifying of the Lord. The photo with these children came against the background of a damaged and burned building. And not far from that place was a whole block of damaged and destroyed high-rise buildings… Thank you sincerely to the Lord and to you for the opportunity for service, for works of charity and evangelization! We still have a number of gifts, and we will continue to serve children and families. We pray that this will happen as effectively as possible and for the glory of God! We look forward to working with you in the future! Praying for you, Serhiy Kozlov, pastor of the Living Hope Church (Zhytomyr), service coordinator.

The funds you kindly sent us helped to transport almost 200 people from Lviv (mainly the railway station) to our House of Prayer, and then to the border with Poland. There was a small base in our church where we received people, our sisters came every day to cook hot food and take care of the rooms where people lived. We managed to re-equip our rooms with Sunday school classes for living rooms, and by purchasing electric heaters we maintained a comfortable temperature in them. At one time, these rooms were equipped with a bathroom with shower and everything you need, in the current circumstances it has become very useful. After staying with us (it sometimes lasted from one to several days), we attracted our brothers with their cars and took people to the border. Most often, for the sake of faster border crossing, we had to go to the checkpoint in Uhryniv, in both directions the road one car covers about 150 km. Thanks to your help, we were able to refuel cars (given the cost and shortage of fuel, this is a very tangible help, because the first weeks of the war the cost of fuel sometimes reached 47 UAH per liter). They were able to buy a considerable amount of food to serve displaced people. We would also like to emphasize that, thanks to your help, we were able to purchase the necessary items for the brothers of our church who serve in the army (bulletproof vests, backpacks, etc.). Several brothers have already been mobilized from our community, and now they are better off. Thank you very much. We continue to work for victory!

<p>
Congratulations to all âàòè My name is Diana, as well as many families from central Ukraine and we had to leave for the safety of our children and us. We have 4 minor children: the eldest daughter is 13, the sons are 11, 5, 2 years old. We came from the Kyiv region from the village of Zabirya (you know the hero cities of Bucha, Irpin and Gostomel - so it is 40 km away from us) and Vasylkiv, which they started bombing from the first day - 20 km. The first day seems to be calm, and then when you realize that it continues to rumble all day and night ñòðàõ fear begins to take over you. The first night we slept together six in the same room with the children on the floor. The second night we spent the night with my sister in a nearby village in the basement of the church. Altogether there were 18 people sleeping on the floor that night in the church. We just slept with our backs to each other. When military planes flew and dropped bombs, fired rockets from Belarus at the airfield, Vasilkov's floor shook beneath us… It was a very long and difficult night for all of us. My sons did not fully understand the situation, and the eldest daughter began to cry from the first words "the war has begun." The next morning at 7 o'clock my husband Leonid decided to send me and my children to Transcarpathia to relatives with friends by minibus. In 20 minutes we gathered (we didn't even return home to pick up the prepared suitcase, only what was with us - baby diapers, changeable clothes for the children once and documents), prepared some food and left. 5 adults and 9 children left us in an old Volkswagen T4. Thank God, the day before our departure, relatives from another city of Kyiv region were driving, they helped us with the route and told us which way to go. At that time we could not move on the Kyiv-Zhytomyr highway, the bridge in Stoyanka was blown up, the highway was constantly shelled, it was blocked. Keep up to date with the news to understand the situation around. In total, we had to drive about 800 km, and we drove 26 hours - constantly on the move. Our driver Vanya (who has a brain cyst) did not even stop to sleep… only refueling and toilet. Already being in the mountains we had to stand in a big traffic jam (for the night we may have driven 10 km), the heater in the car did not work at all, we stood all night in a traffic jam in the mountains, where the snow was knee-deep. My hair froze to the glass, the children froze hard… we just lay on the floor, put the children's feet on their feet and rub the body so as not to freeze .. I'm the same with Masha (this is the mother of 2 children who went with us, her husband was the driver) rubbed legs to each other..?? These are the moments you will not be able to forget all your life… constantly tears in your eyes and thoughts whether we will return there again ?? Thank God I had a place to go. That I have sisters and brothers in Transcarpathia. That not only I but also my friends were able to leave on time and be safe. All of us were met by Tanya - she is my older sister, she fed us hot food and we live and now she has her, for which I am very grateful to her and Slavik. 4 days after we left, my husband left. He took some of our neighbors and together we drove to Western Ukraine as well. Thank God, the road was difficult, but He saved and we are here now. I want to thank everyone who helps us and our children and our country ???? May the Lord reward everyone for their good deeds ?? Now we feel safe. We have food, we already have clothes, warm beds and everything we need for every day. A little bit of how many of us there were in the first days when I came with the children. All who lived in Tanya and Slavik were 36 people in one house. But all of us together strangers or relatives helped each other, prepared food for everyone, cleaned and shared their experiences and little joys. Some went abroad, most who came with us stayed here. We continue to pray to God first of all for the war, and we are also learning to continue living in this difficult time for Ukraine ?????? Thank you again to each of you for your prayers and help ??

Great honor to the Samaritan Bag mission and endless words of gratitude from the people who were able to get help thanks to your money. We managed to open a help center for migrants and bought an incredible amount of necessary things and products. In cooperation with the city's social services, we were able to provide important assistance to those who needed it at this difficult time, especially families with children. We also bought 5 hard socks 500 plates, several sleeping bags and first aid kits, which we sent to the military where it was hot.

The most beautiful Samaritan Bag !!! Thank you very much for such unexpected support and such a necessary at this difficult time for our country. We in Transcarpathia have become a place of refuge for our whole country. Our church accepts many immigrants. Thousands of families have passed through us, now we have 212 migrants. We support 600 families with products. These are people who came with nothing and need everything. That is why we need these funds very much. We buy food, mattresses, hold various activities for children so that they can be distracted from the war, we also buy equipment for housing, pay for utilities, refuel for cars, help families financially, buy uniforms for some soldiers, and make baby shavers. for resettled women and gave them everything they need for newborn babies. Thank you sincerely for your financial help) These finances were very useful to us and we were able to help more. We do it together with you, thank you for your open hearts to Ukraine ??We believe that victory is coming soon) We look forward to this day)

Thanks to your support, our dear partners, we were able to help people who so needed and need support at this difficult time for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. These are children, their parents and the elderly, whom we helped to evacuate from battlefields. We placed them in the Church, in the houses and many of our brothers took them home. We fully provided them with everything they needed: clothes, food, medicine, hygiene products, took the needy to the hospital ... We did everything necessary to make them comfortable Many broken lives, broken families who have nowhere to return, many tears, many sorrows. Our Church is extremely grateful for the financial support that allowed us to help people and witness to them at the same time. about love of God. We went from Irpin, took with themselves the pregnant woman, her husband and their son. We were given a green corridor for 20 minutes. Going by them they started shooting from submachine guns and from tanks and it was the real hell. God's miracle, we came out alive and the rest of the cars that followed us were shot, they all died. We were helped to evacuate people to the army, which we also had the opportunity to witness and two of them believed in Jesus Christ. And the family living in Unas also believed. Thank God for these souls. Thank you sincerely for your support, for your love.

We truly thank the entire Samaritan Bag team for the funds provided to us as a church. During this difficult time, church members and other people in the occupied village of Donskoye received food aid. Assistance is also provided to migrants in Transcarpathia from Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kyiv, especially to families with small children. Thank you for the opportunity to help people. All people who were assisted are very grateful. Doing good together is possible. We will share other testimonies in the near future.

Many thanks to all who take part in helping the people of Ukraine in such difficult times. Thank you for the money you received from Samaritan's Bag. - Our church is on the border with Poland, it is Ustyluh. Our first service was to help the refugees with hot tea, food, warmth, a place to stay temporarily, spend the night. And we were not immediately ready to help so many people: tea, coffee, sandwiches, hot food, disposable tableware .... Therefore, financial assistance was very important to us. - not all people go abroad, some families stay in our city. Some of the migrants were given old houses to live in, thanks to these funds we were able to buy the necessary bed, utensils (for the first time), clothes (some came in what they were, in steamed shoes), food for families. - Many migrants just need food. (Especially those who stayed in the villages) So we try to provide them with at least the most necessary products, sometimes we organize dinners for them just at home, conduct pastoral work, invite to church service - A lot of money is spent on fuel to deliver everything needed to migrants , meet, drive to the border, .... - people are amazed at the kindness of other people, sacrifice, willingness to serve. With tears in their eyes, thank you for your help. Without the funds you provided, we would not have been able to help the needy during the war in our country. Thank you very much. May God bless you.

Good afternoon, dear brothers and sisters! Thank you very much for your support, prayers and financial assistance. Since the first days of the war, our organization (church) has been able to evacuate approximately 5,000 people from the city of Sumy and the Sumy region, namely Trostyanets, Okhtyrka and Boromlya. We were also able to deliver and distribute about 30 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians and the military. They bought medicine and food for the needy. Twice a week in the city center, our team of volunteers feeds the needy with hot lunches (About 70 people a week). Thank the Lord for the opportunity to serve people and bring them the good news of salvation??thank the Lord for your open hearts and help?? God's blessings to you??

The money received made it possible for the people of the city of Kherson to receive medicines that they had to get from the city of Odessa, driving from the occupation to Ukraine and back, which requires a lot of courage and, of course, finances. And also thanks to this help, we were able to evacuate some of the people who could not pay the full fare. We also made local grocery purchases and distributed to those in need through the Golgotha Church, where we serve. There are many people who were satisfied and wrote thank you messages. Thank you for helping our city and our church. Today, unfortunately, most of the church has left the city, humanitarian aid is enough to support the remaining people, and there is still a supply of money left. Thank you very much??

From the first day of war we began to evacuate people from Nikolaev, refueling cars at the expense. Thank you very much for your help, which we immediately sent to refuel for cars! Every day we continue to take out from 9 to 60 people. We have established several evacuation routes with partner churches from other cities, we work together. We leave, sometimes they come or meet and so we help people in Nikolaev, the Nikolaev area and if possible people from the Kherson area! At the same time, we are constantly working on the delivery of humanitarian aid, both in the villages and to people in the city, we bring food and hygiene products! We also buy medicines for sick elderly people who do not have the opportunity to do so! In the basement of the church we create more favorable conditions for sheltering people, bomb shelters and for overnight stays of migrants. Lay polystyrene foam on the floor and put the door. From the first days until today we help the military, deliver the necessary things to the checkpoints and locations! Many people left our church. But now most new people come to communicate, we treat them! Thank you very much for your support! She is very much needed and on time!

From the first days of the war, our local church received refugees from the Luhansk region who lived on the basis of the church, and we also resettled them in the homes of believers, helping them with the necessary products, medicines and hygiene products. In addition, the church was able to reach more than 150 SJO families (large, disabled and single) during the month, also helping with essentials. After the situation in the region worsened, we started evacuating people to the western regions of Ukraine, which we continue to do today - we take humanitarian aid to the East, and people from there. Thank God for your partnership and help!

Our church bought about 5 tons of potatoes, 2 tons of flour, 500 liters of oil, helped with diesel fuel for the brothers who took aid to the regions of war. We found and sent about 30 aid vehicles to the regions of hostilities. We helped immigrant families traveling to Europe, were able to receive and send on to their destination. We were also able to prepare hot lunches every week for people who are currently out of work and in need. Thank you very much to the Lord and to you for these funds and the opportunity to serve other people in these difficult times.

We are sincerely grateful for such significant financial assistance for our church! From the very beginning of the Russian aggression, we, as a church, have identified several main areas of work, namely: assistance to refugees with settlement and deportation; assistance to the military and their families; collection and dispatch of humanitarian aid to hot regions where hostilities are taking place, as well as assistance to migrants who remain in Lviv. We were able to organize mobile transport crews to take people to the border and transported about 600 women and children in a month. We were able to help with the temporary settlement of about 800 people. During this time, we sent food aid to Sumy, Gostomel, Bucha, Pokrovsk, Kramatorsk, Kyiv and other cities. When the flow of people to Lviv decreased, we rented premises in the shopping center (New Central Department Store) and opened a humanitarian center to help refugees and military families, where people in need can get clothes, shoes, food, medicine, as well as spiritual and psychological help. In the two weeks of the Message for Action humanitarian hub, more than 1,000 people have received important assistance, and we continue to look for opportunities to serve those affected by the war. As part of this work, we organize master classes for IDP children to help children feel cared for and safe! We have started cooperating with educational institutions in our district, which have opened the doors for the settlement of temporarily displaced persons and our desire to feed these people, because every day people who lack food and necessary hygiene come to our help center. Thanks again for your help and open to further cooperation!

Since the war, we GO Perspektyva Ye has hosted about 500 people with children. We always needed money for food, things, and personal hygiene, we give linen to the laundry, because people often change, fuel for drivers who carry humanitarian aid, linen, and food.  The brothers of our church take women with children and large families to the Polish border. They went there twice a day. Since the beginning of the war, about 750 people have been transported. The money went to gasoline/ diesel, to change the oil in cars … These are the realities of our center. refugees come with different health conditions, there was also a woman with stage 4 cancer, and a grandmother of 90 years.  We were the part of the transportation of night vision devices from Poland to Ukraine (Kharkiv and Dnipro).   We started an outreach Bible group for nonbelievers. Here are men from different parts of Ukraine (Kyiv,Luhansk,Zaporizhya). Please pray that they would come closer to God.  At the end of March we had our an English club. There were 15 young people, 10 of them are unbelievers who are not even sure that God exists, the club went great. we had an English class and read the Gospel of John. Then shared the gospel again and again to make sure they understand where they are and who is God.  Andriy is 1 year old,Mother Vika arrived from Kirovograd go to hospital for surgery. He has heart disease. Now our church takes care of this family in hospital. We visited militaries of Armed Forces of Ukraine in a milinary hospital and brought them Ester bread, food and Gospels.  We are grateful for your participation in our ministry by prayers and finances.

Congratulations. The funds received by the church in the village of Dovhovolya helped us a lot. Thanks to them, the church was able to purchase and send food packages to areas that were particularly affected by the war. They bought sewing machines and fabric for sewing unloadings for soldiers on the front line. They bought flour and some other products for baking bread and bakery products for soldiers and people living in the occupied and liberated territories and were left without basic necessities. We also helped people who temporarily moved to our area and bought them everything they needed. Part of the funds was allocated for people with cancer to purchase expensive medicines, as many people lost their jobs due to martial law. We sincerely thank God from the bottom of our hearts that He has placed your compassionate hearts to help us financially in this difficult time for our country!

Many thanks to the Lord and to all those who joined this project. May our God reward you for your sacrifice and bless you without measure. The funds that were given to us were a great blessing for our local church, as well as for many people in our city and nearby villages. We were able to buy food and medicine, hygiene products and fuel. They collected food kits and distributed them to vulnerable groups, the disabled and families with children, as well as their church members. Already received assistance, more than 300 families and now, we are forming a stock of products that can be distributed to those who find themselves in difficult life circumstances due to the war. The Lord allowed us to support the Armed Forces with products that were used to feed the soldiers in our territorial community. Also during these two months, we have repeatedly supported the orphanage for children with physical and / or mental disabilities and mental disorders, buying them sweets and food ... Helped in the purchase of drugs for the new company of the Armed Forces, formed. from our compatriots. They also helped to treat three seriously injured young men. We paid for the delivery of one truck of humanitarian cargo to our region. We replenished the phones of church members who did not have the opportunity to do so ... We thank God that they are such sacrificial people as you and we glorify His Holy Name!

With these funds, we partially purchased food for the needy; for everyday lunches, (at the request of our local authorities) we feed the people of Ter Oborona, and this is forty people every day, unfortunately it is impossible to provide a photo (for security reasons); we were also able to provide one-time assistance in the form of a meal for six hundred children and adults who heard the Good News from these same products; and on the Easter holiday, twice God helped to get together (it’s dangerous for us) and hold a festive event for children with their parents ... They also helped families with food and bought a little flour, cereals, sugar, so that refugees could be accepted (it’s not always possible to help with money ). In our area, those who came from the "hot" places, everyone was placed at home, but we are preparing to receive more people, and we have a room with a capacity of 100 people, but it is designed for warmer weather ... We built in last year the “bathhouse” building, so that you could have the opportunity to wash yourself with hot water, and so it’s cheaper than paying for electricity; but we didn’t finish, due to lack of funds ... and we invested the remaining money from your help here too ... we decided that it was very necessary, for refugees at this time ... and in the summer we plan (we believe and hope) to collect children and see them off camp: with an overnight stay for 5-7 days ... And we also have two villages where, since Christmas meetings, we continue to communicate with children and spend time together studying the Bible ..., money has also been allocated there, received from the mission "Bag Samaritan "...! In general, it was a great help and very timely! All money is distributed under the supervision of heaven, with a clear conscience and to the Glory of God! Thank God for you! Thank you for the "big heart"! God bless you all and all areas of your life!

We are very grateful for this opportunity to serve the people in this difficult time for the people of Ukraine. We had this problem with my phone. Since the phone is old and there was not enough memory in it and the problem was that it often happened that the photos on it disappeared, wrote (no content), and the battery did not hold much, and then it happened that the phone rang and we could not extract a photo from it. I bought a new Samsung phone. We prayed that he would somehow restore the photo from the old phone, and thank God he managed to do it. With the new phone, we will be able to continue to take photos much more successfully and safely. Thank God!

Glory to Jesus Christ, Christ is Risen! Thank you for your help, it is wonderful to feel God's support through brothers and sisters, to see the rays of light in these difficult dark days of war. Today we have two months of war, our Church is far from the front lines, but we feel the war every day. We accept the second influx of migrants from Eastern and Southern Ukraine, settle them in the House of Prayer, and organize a center for humanitarian aid at the church. During this time we have helped more than 200 families with food kits, things, hygiene products resettlement was inhabited by 30 migrants from Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, we provided them with everything they needed for a comfortable stay, now these people have gone to their homes or rather what is left of their homes, with your help we help such people with young children to find places to accommodation in their settlements and help with the payment of accommodation for the first month. We continue to help mothers who have lost milk due to stress and can not breastfeed their babies for them, we buy baby food and medicine for babies, diapers. With the arrival of spring, children begin beriberi, parents save and buy only what they need, so we continue to buy fresh fruits and vitamins. We have many horrific stories of people fleeing the war, feeling the breath of death behind them, people fleeing through the woods with their children, people riding bicycles and seeing the families of others killed. It is the hard work of pastoral care, giving people hope and the belief that God will fix everything, you just have to wait.

Our Church is infinitely grateful to the Samaritan's Bag. In this particularly difficult time for our country, we feel God's love through you more than ever. Your charitable help allows us to take care of people and, most importantly, to bring them the Good News. Since we received the funds, more than one and a half hundred people in our city, whom we visited in person, received food, heard the gospel, and were invited to worship. The nearby villages, which were recently de-occupied, were visited separately. Our city of Sumy was under siege for a long time, at first there were not enough products in the shops, later they became much more expensive. It took a long time to stand in line, to get to the other end of town. As public transport did not work for the elderly, disabled, mothers with young children, it was a real problem to buy the necessary products. Now Sumy region has been liberated from invaders, but enemy shelling of communities near the border continues, and the threat of missile strikes remains. Life goes on, the work of many institutions is resumed. In the days before Easter, there was a warning about the threat of shelling on the holiday. Our enemy is also the enemy of God, because his goal is the building of the Church, the gathering of people. Despite such threats, about two dozen people we visited came to worship for us at Easter. Among them were parents of children with disabilities, single mothers, retirees, immigrants from Kharkiv. Some mothers expressed an interest in their children attending a Christian children's club in the future. Others expressed gratitude for their help and participation in their lives. We had the opportunity to visit the small village of Artemo-Rastivka, which was located at a great distance from the city, there is almost no road to it, and there are not enough necessary things. Since there are only about 30 people, we organized a small meeting. People listened to and accepted the Word of God, supported the prayer for our country, for the soldiers and the approach of our people to the Lord. In one of the villages where our volunteers live, food kits were distributed. Over time, a prayer hour was organized there, and a short meeting is held every night on the street. There are spiritual meditations, a prayer in which three families take part. Some of the people we visited joined our volunteer movement. Because of this, some of them have already attended our services several times. Among these people is Sergei. Until recently, he had a drug addiction, now there is a struggle in his soul. He understands that without God's support he cannot cope. He is touched by the testimonies of the people of our Church whom God has set free and given new life. He is also hindered by his religious worldview, which is aimed at fulfilling certain traditions without a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Now he is with Christians for some time, his example of life affects him. This is more important than many guidelines. He seeks to help people because he is now unemployed and understands people's needs. We believe that God will surely convert him to Himself and he will be our brother in Christ. We also ask God to give us the opportunity to receive people from areas where it is very restless. Many cities have simply been wiped off the face of the earth, and people cannot leave the occupied territories because they are being purposefully shelled and not released. Now, more than ever, we see the power of prayers that are heard in different cities of the planet and bring us closer to victory over darkness!

Since the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, our church has been actively involved in the reception of migrants, who later settled in the area. Thanks to the funds you donated, we were able to purchase food for the temporarily displaced, which is an average of 150 people a day, three meals a day, and service the transport that took people to the checkpoint. Thank you very much for your sacrificial hearts! You are helping the victory of Ukraine! May the Lord bless you!

Kulykivska, 50/2 tel .: +38 050 957 36 27 Ex. ¹ 35/22 From April 25, 2022 Letter of thanks Dear servants, beloved brothers and sisters of the Samaritan's Bag Mission. The pastors of Sumy region, the people of God of all the churches of Sumy region who are subordinated to the regional mission of the Source of Life Center, are sincerely grateful to you for their mercy and zeal. We have received your financial support for our churches. Sumy region has been surrounded for more than a month, there was no centralized supply of food and medicine, fuel, so your help came to us as God's blessing for God's children. We thank you for your efforts, fundraising and funding for the Churches of the Sumy region. The funds were used for the purchase of food and the formation of food kits provided to church members and residents of the most affected areas of Sumy region: Putivl, Krasnopil, Bilopil, Trostyanets and other communities. The families of the military and the Territorial Defense received food support. A service was organized in the Sumy Correctional Facility ¹116, where food supplies were restricted during the occupation, and humanitarian aid was also provided for workers and prisoners. We cooperated with the Geriatric Boarding House, medical institutions and the homeless shelter. Thanks to you, support is provided for large families, the elderly, people with disabilities. A separate area of funding is the provision of assistance to the visually impaired. During the occupation, the purchase and delivery of necessary medicines to the region was organized. Transport costs for the delivery of humanitarian goods and evacuation of residents were paid. Financial support was also given to the families of those who do their best to do charity and volunteer work. May our great Lord Jesus Christ bless you abundantly! Yours faithfully, Head of the Source of Life Mission, Bishop of the Churches of the Central Executive Committee of the Sumy Oblast CEE _____________ MB Nelin

Glory to Jesus Christ and sincere thanks to the people who sacrifice for us in difficult times. These funds have become a great blessing for the church and the people, not only in our area. We gave part of the money for the evacuation of people from hot spots to another church and with the same church on Easter Sunday sent the military "pasochki" and food in Lugansk and Donetsk regions. Another part of the money went to food kits, which we distributed directly and continue to distribute in our village. There are families who have lost their income due to the situation in the country, lonely old people, families whose parents volunteered for the front. There are also a significant number of migrants. There are families with disabilities, bought them diapers and some medicine. People are very grateful. Many thank you with tears in your eyes. Thank you to all the sacrificial people who helped our church serve others in this difficult time. Bless you!

Now 80% of the members of our church have left Kharkiv, but the church has a ministry, namely: packs and delivers food aid to Aleksiivtsi, Zhukovsky and Saltivka. I also deliver food to the villages of Depgachiv and Zolochev districts. At the same time, the distribution of aid is accompanied by the proclamation of the Gospel. The church is evacuating residents from Balakleya, Ruska Lozova, Prudyanka, Ud. The Samaritan's bag is spent on fuel and car repairs. So far, we receive products to help from various charitable foundations. If such discoveries cease, we may purchase the Products for these funds.

Thanks to the funds received through the Samaritan's Bag, we were able to serve people in the Sumy region, in particular in Sumy, Trostyanets, Okhtyrka, Krasnopillya, Bilopillya, Velyka Pisarivka and other villages around these settlements. We tried to serve the more needy sections of the population who were under occupation or affected by the fighting. Disabled people, families with many children and families with foster children, elderly people and mothers with small children were especially helped. Our city of Sumy was also under siege. At the beginning of the war, we tried to buy food and medicine wherever possible. They also spent money on personal hygiene items and fuel. In every place and in every contact they tried to speak the Good News, about Christ and His way of salvation for all people. We put a New Testament in each food set. We also helped with the evacuation of people who wanted to leave dangerous places. People have felt the love of Christ in a special way through the touch of the local church, thanks to your donations. Thank you very much for the money received. May the Lord bless you abundantly!

In all these photos delivery of products! Some were bought, some were provided for free! They took me to Kyiv, Bucha, Katyuzhanka, Ivankiv, Makariv and villages in the north of Kyiv region! Medicines were also purchased and transferred to the Kyiv Central Military Hospital, the Kyiv Ambulance Hospital, and the Ivankiv District Hospital. People were also evacuated from Bucha, Irpin, and Varash to the Polish border. Our Church is infinitely grateful to you for not being indifferent. Without your help, it would be much harder for us to serve people in such difficult times! Thank you!

This financial assistance was very necessary for our ministers to help people who came to Odessa from different cities and villages where there were shelling or military battles. We refueled the cars and could go to the villages, buy and deliver food, evacuate people from Nikolaev to the Moldovan border, buy medicines, prepare food for refugees, territorial defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Our city of Verkhnodniprovsk is small, but received more than 3 thousand migrants. Humanitarian aid did not reach our city. Therefore, it was decided to buy food kits. We were the only ones at the time who helped the IDPs with food. We connected with schools and called families with children who registered at schools. Local families who remained in difficulty also received assistance. These packages were delivered to homes. We prayed for each family, talked. When people received food packages, they called and thanked again because they did not expect such necessary products. Every family heard that God loves and cares for them. Tears in the eyes of parents and happy eyes of children, because the child received gifts from the Samaritan Bag, which miraculously remained from last year. We put our hearts, prayers and love into this project. Many people from the church were volunteers. It is an honor for us. Many thanks to the Samaritan Sumka, who is with Ukraine at this time. We appreciate.

Congratulations, dear ones. Many thanks to God that we can do the work of the Lord together in these difficult times for Ukraine and its people. Thanks to your financial help, we were able to repair many houses in the village of Veselivka that were damaged as a result of the failure of Russian cruise missiles of ammunition depots. Slate from houses just blew up, windows fell out. We could repair house after house by replacing the slate so that water would not flow on the heads of the people who live there. In our village there were and are many immigrants from Bucha, Irpin, Makarov, Kiev, Borodyanka, Kherson, Narodich, Mariupol. All of these families were provided with the necessary food and clothing, and some with housing. During this time there were many trips to take people out, deliver food and other needs and thanks to your help could refuel cars. May God generously bless everyone who helps in these difficult times.

Our dear brothers and sisters of the Samaritan Bag Mission, thank you very much for your help in helping people during the war. During this difficult and unusual time, you and I have done a lot here in Ukraine, and more needs to be done, because destroyed cities and villages, wounded people, orphans, refugees need various help. You blessed the refugees we received at the unfinished rehab center, heated them, installed doors and windows, and made a kitchen for them. During these two months, 25 blind people were settled there - migrants and their companions, as well as children. To this day, we feed them, clothe them, treat them, pay for gas and electricity, spend money on fuel, and pay utility bills for refugees who have settled in our homes and neighbors' apartments. Funds were also donated to the army. We give them food, medicine, bought a bulletproof vest. The temporarily displaced refugees are very grateful for your help. May the Lord bless you all. With prayer and love, employees of the Trust Charitable Foundation.

We are sincerely grateful to the Samaritan Bag for the funds provided. They have really been a great help to us in difficult times. Thanks to these funds, we were able to renovate and open the Humanitarian Aid Center at our Church, where we distribute food, clothing and hygiene products to IDPs and all people in need. We also pack and send products to people who live in villages or towns and are unable to come to the Humanitarian Center. We bought a lot of flour and now we have a team that makes dumplings for soldiers and for all those in need. We also dry vegetables for instant soup kits, thanks to which we were able to pay the electricity bill, which turned out to be quite large. In addition, we bought carrots, cabbage and other vegetables for soup sets. Thank you very much again - thanks to your generous help, many people both inside and outside the church were able to get what they needed for their lives. May God bless you abundantly!

We thank you very much for your financial assistance and cooperation in the field of God. Our city of Zaporozhye has become a shelter and transit place for people who escaped from shelling and active military aggression. Thanks to your help, we have the opportunity to help a large number of people in a difficult situation. We collect and distribute food bags, clothing, personal care and essentials. We arrive at the addresses where the IDPs temporarily live and bring them hot meals, bake pies at checkpoints. We help in the hospice with diapers and products, we cut the disabled people's hair and everything is based on the Evangelization of souls. We feed the homeless and the poor on the street, since there are no jobs in the city, many are in poverty. We carry out evangelizations for adults and children everywhere with Samaritan gifts. People are very grateful to God for His mercy that they were able to escape from the shelling themselves and save the lives of children. A lot of mothers with babies thank for diapers, baby clothes and all the help provided to them. This is at least a little encouraging and inspires people not to lose heart and live in hope in this terrible time of war. Thank you again that we can do one thing together in the Name of the Lord. God bless you for your open hearts to the misfortune of your neighbor.

We truly thank God for your kind hearts and thank you that with your help we can help those people in need during the difficult times of war. We had the opportunity to visit families in need. We were able to bring the Word of God to those who do not yet know Jesus as the personal Lord and Savior, and we were able to help brothers and sisters who lost their jobs and had children because of the war. We visited the families of people who have been displaced by the war. - Brother Volodya Korniychuk was helped with 2,000 hryvnias, paid for the gas he spent on receiving refugees at home. - Sveta Konanchuk does not have a pension because the cards are blocked and you have to pay for gas. 2000 hryvnias. - Boychenko Maria needed money for treatment, she is a pensioner. - Dovbysh Halyna has two children, but she and her husband lost their jobs due to the war. We helped with this blessing of 3,000 hryvnias. - Vashchuk Olena is a single woman without a family, she was blessed, she is a pensioner, UAH 1,000. - Polishchuk Lydia is not able to take care of herself, they left with her daughter and needed help, 2000 hryvnias. They also allocated funds for a family where they lost their mother and left two children, the eldest takes care of a younger child aged 19 and 12. They are in need. With your help, we also had the opportunity to allocate funds for the Hope for All Charitable Foundation. He takes care of a home for the elderly, our fraternity, located in Dovbysh. Blessed 30,000 hryvnias. And for the bank's services 300 hryvnias. We had the opportunity to visit migrant families and speak the Word of God and asked what they needed to help.

Thanks to the help you have received, our Church has managed to do a lot of good during these difficult times of the war with Russia, not only for the members of the Good News Church, but also for other people who are suffering from the racist invasion. When our city was under a three-way siege in the first days of the war and there was a great need for food, hygiene, medicine, etc. It is thanks to your help that we managed to buy these scarce items and provide them free of charge to those who really need them - both in the Church and on the road, especially when the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated our temporarily occupied towns and villages. We must not forget the eyes of people who kissed bread with tears ... We also managed to help our Territorial Defense and Ambulance Hospital, but the emphasis was on targeted assistance to people through a mini-headquarters in the Church, where specific needs were collected and food was delivered. and medication. We are very grateful for your open to God and people who are not indifferent to the suffering of people's hearts!

Thanks from hundreds of migrants, whom I helped to live through these two months at your expense. Many of them know me, greet me, thank me and now come to work for me every day - a whole volunteer center has been formed here in the lobby. Fellow villagers demolish things, conservation. I buy cereals, household goods, potatoes and everything that people need. ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency) paid for the factory for a month, they baked bread for the settlers, the local mill gave me 250 kg for free. flour, and another volunteer got us a thousand goose eggs! So people come every day for bread and we talk to them. Because they need not only carnal bread, but also spiritual bread. They want to talk to someone, share the fact that their house is gone, how they ran away barefoot ... this girl is 3 years old, a rocket fell into a neighboring building and wounded her with shrapnel.

Thank you for sending financial assistance for the second time. Indeed, the funds have already run out, because these two months there was an intensive influx of migrants, and we distributed aid to 5-7 families every day. I counted about what I wrote: with your money we fully helped 100 families with 300 adults and 150 children! This is approximately not taking into account the cost of gasoline and isolated cases. Now the influx has slept a little, but those who live here for 2 places, now need again. Some give in the second round, some ask what is over - I add. Now people need to change clothes, because they were fleeing in the winter, and the heat has come - fellow villagers are taking away their things, just a good opportunity to clean the attics and give to those who need it.

God is before us, His glory is before us. Where we do not go, where we do not turn - everyone knows us. Last week, even a local newspaper wrote an article about us. People don't mind me taking pictures of them, everyone understands that it is necessary to submit reports and receive funds. I try to talk to everyone, hug, bless. Recently there was a Volunteer Day, then familiar acquaintances greeted us. - Nice. One woman peeked into a bag full of groceries and shouted, "Wow!" and wept.

Glory to Jesus Christ. Congratulations, dear employees of the Samaritan Bag, on this day our officials have purchased and formed almost 60 food packages, which were distributed to people in need, namely the elderly, and who were forced to leave their homes due to hostilities or occupation, these are people with small children and those in poor living conditions. We also bought various medicines that people needed, that is, almost twenty people. In our city there is a great need for drinking water, because there is no more two weeks of water. We want to deliver water to those who cannot physically do it themselves. We are amazed at how willing people are to receive help and the Word of God. Thank you for your mission to enable us to serve our people.

Many thanks to the brothers and sisters of the Samaritan Bag for your participation in serving our country and our Church at this difficult time. God has guided our church in this special way. At first, when we received funds from you, we did not know what to do with them: many people left our church and our volunteer ministry was not developed. We were already thinking of joining another church to help them. But later in the Khimik Palace of Culture in Rivne, where we rent office space, the city authorities opened a clothing center for temporarily displaced people. We met the responsible people of this center and asked them if people needed products. We were told that they ask very often, but they don't have any. Then we decided to make a delivery point in our office. Many members of the church immediately agreed to participate. First we made 20 packages for the test, then 50. And they all left, there was no need to look for people, they came themselves. Then one of our brothers, who is a very strong evangelist, suggested that evangelism be given along with the distribution of food, and he knew exactly how to do it. And everything went very well. Today we distribute 100 food packages three times a week, we divide people into 3 groups of more than 30 people, each group has its time, and while people register, they sit and listen to the Word of God, then prayer. Our church members say that we have, as Christ did, trough the bread and teach by the word. Thank you very much again for your participation, may God bless you. If we have the opportunity to join this cause, we will be very grateful, because many people are still coming with the need, and our opportunities are running out. Pray for Ukraine that the war will end and people will not need this service with food packages that we are currently conducting

Thanks to the funds from the Samaritan’s Bag, our church is serving people in the occupied territory in this difficult time in their needs and problems. in which people were taken from the occupied city to the bus. People were evacuated and food was delivered 4 times. They refueled the bus (there was an export of people to western Ukraine) and cars. Humanitarian aid was provided in Balakliya, Pyatigorsk, Verbovka, and district camps). The city is now closed to entry. It’s hard to come in… But we still find ways to bring medicines and food to people in need. Our brothers and sisters have repeatedly come under fire, but the Lord is merciful and He keeps. We help with food packages, medicines, financially. We hold worship services in three places in Balakliya (at the temple, in the city center and near the camps), because people are afraid to move long distances. Unbelievers began to come. We pray for God's opportunities in ministry. It is very difficult, but we believe that nothing is impossible for God. Thank you for such a tangible financial support of our ministry!!!! May the Lord richly bless you and reward you a hundredfold!!!

Church of the Way of Love Ovruch, thank you very much for financial support and prayers, thanks to your support we were able to do many good deeds for people, for the Lord Our city is located 30 kilometers from Belarus in the north of Zhytomyr region. missiles - bombings, in the city and in the villages. From the first days the church was involved in supporting the people of our community, our prayer house served as a bomb shelter for 60 people for many days, thanks to the support we fed these people in the church. Medicines have also run out in the city and we, as a church, have set up a "medicine aid point". People were constantly stressed, there was high blood pressure, heart problems, and many people died because of it. The church was a point of salvation, helped by prayer and medicine. We also evacuated people from our city to western Ukraine and abroad. People are very grateful. During this time, immigrants from Bucha and Irpen moved to our city, and we helped them with food. More than 1,000 people received assistance. Thank you very much, God bless you.

Thanks to financial support, we can buy food, medicine, fuel and necessary hygiene products. We help with products, medicines, and partly with means of hygiene for large, socially unprotected families, the elderly, the disabled and others. Helped with medicines for children's city resuscitation, defense, Armed Forces. The SES and the Defense Forces helped with the products. In fact, each aid is a separate testimony. Many with tears in their eyes received help and were very grateful for the food, medicine, attention, prayer and just a timely good word of support. Below are some testimonies from people: Good evening, we are from Ukraine, my name is Ilona. I would very much like to thank you for the help I was given more than once when I was having a hard time. These are the products I really needed. Medicines she couldn't buy anywhere. Because I had hypertension and medication for pressure and headaches. I really want to thank everyone who took part in this. You are incredible. Thank God he sent you to me. And I was not hungry on any of those terrible days, and thanks to the medicine my health was safe. Thank you very much ?????????????????????? I am grateful to every person who showed love with his actions, sacrificing his finances. My husband and I were fired during the war, but thanks to the sacrifices of the people, we are provided with food ourselves and can give to others. Thank you and bless you in your prayers. May the Lord repay 100 times. ???? Accept sincere gratitude for the medicines we desperately need to sustain life. Our boundless honor and respect to all of you who opened your hearts and did not spare your own money for the sake of complete strangers from Ukraine, who are suffering today from the Russian invasion. May God protect you, increase your wealth and always be indifferent !!! Thank you !!! ??????

Some of the funds were spent on utilities for the house of prayer, during the stay of a large number of migrants (from 50-150 people per night). Then, 500 food packages were collected and distributed in Vinnytsia and Vinnytsia region to people who lost their homes and suffered from this war.

Refugees who came to Easter received gift sets for Easter. Almost all refugees attended such services for the first time, and they enjoyed the service so much that almost all said they would be happy to come to the next service and read the New Testament. Thank God!

<p>
We truly thank the Seventh-day Adventist Church for its financial support during the war. Thanks to your support, people were helped: food kits, hygiene products, medicines, baby food, and multiple evacuations were carried out. Experience-1 During the shelling and bombing of Sumy, 11 people (including 6 children) were taken away in a small car. we prayed asking the Lord to save. We saw shots and bombs explode, but they were all taken out and unharmed. The children were frightened but have already undergone rehabilitation. If they had not been taken out that day, it is unknown what would have happened a day later because their place of residence had been damaged. Experience-2 Thanks to financial support, medicines were purchased for patients who could be provided. They thank you for salvation through medicine. When they learned that this was done in the name of God and their lives changed, they said teach us to live as you do. These people are now studying Bible lessons. Experience-3 4-year-old girl who was left alone her parents died, now we help her, provide for all needs.

Anna Pavlovna, 91 years old, lying down. Five years ago my legs gave out. No kids. The husband died a long time ago. No relatives or friends either. She lies by herself in a house that has begun to fall. The house has not been renovated for a very long time. She began to open up more, to tell what was wrong in her life and what she would like to change. We told her about different biblical heroes, and said that this has already happened and is repeated in the lives of many people. A woman is open to God and accepts everything that she is told about Him. We gave her the New Testament, it lies next to her bed, we see that she is reading it. She is always glad to see us and always asks God to pray with her and for her. The neighbor who looks after Anna Pavlovna always welcomes us with joy. She is moved by the fact that strangers began to visit the old woman and bring her food packages. She, too, listens attentively to every word about God. A neighbor brings, if possible, food for Anna Pavlovna. The neighbor's son comes to heat the room where Anna Pavlovna lives. She was very happy to see us and get help. Glad someone remembers her.

Palms of hope Children's palms ... If you think they can !? So small ... no, not even tender - tiny. Eleven children are brought up in our family-type orphanage: two biological and nine foster children. Ten of them are under ten years old. Interesting, funny, noisy, but sometimes they still remember the sad pages of their childhood memory. Once six-year-old Elijah, sincerely rejoicing in a delicious dinner, suddenly remembered that once he had nothing to eat. So he wandered around the garbage cans and looked in the trash: "Some bread ..." This story was an unpleasant burden on the soul, but it was from it that the new story of "palms of hope" began. Little Elijah and the rest of the kids help their mother bake bread to give to poor people who, like them, are looking for this piece of bread, the "edge" of hope, love, help in this life. Children, especially Elijah, are very happy that they, even with their little hands, can somehow help people. And today they are just happy !!! After all, their palms are firmly pressed against such wonderful surprise boxes, wrapped in a magic ribbon from the "Bag of the Samaritan"! They had a childhood without bread, let alone gifts! Some of them have health problems. Elijah suffers from certain mental disorders. So we brought all the necessary medicines, detergents and diapers for our youngest baby. We truly thank YOU for YOUR palms of kindness, hope and love, which have been extended to our Ukraine and its children for so many years. Thank the LORD for YOU, YOUR example and YOUR work!

Good afternoon, the funds allowed us to serve people who are temporarily forced to leave their homes. To take such people to safer cities, and to show God's love by giving food kits, at the time of writing we were approached by people from more than 100 settlements in six regions. Our church continues this ministry and we are very grateful for your help in this ministry. They were also able to hold an Easter holiday for children.

Lviv Theological Seminary provides shelter for refugees from the war zone. During the war, we found temporary accommodation for more than 3,000 people, as well as more than 500 children. We also feed the displaced three times a day, help with medicines and clothes, and provide transport to the border. Every day we have from 100 to 150 people at a time. We hold evening prayers for refugees. Lviv Theological Seminary also sends humanitarian aid to people in the East, Center, South and North of Ukraine. We have sent more than 30 tons of aid to people in places that have been liberated from occupation.

Our team welcomes migrants from the occupied territories who have been forced to leave their cities and villages due to active hostilities caused by military aggression by the Russian Federation. For the most part, people are left homeless because many houses have been hit by shells and people have been left on the streets without livelihoods. Thanks to the cooperation with the "Samaritan's Bag" and your financial participation, we complete food kits, personal hygiene items, essentials, clothing, as well as baby food and diapers for mothers with children. Before distributing food kits, we evangelize adults and children separately, after which we distribute Samaritan's Bag boxes. Thank you sincerely for putting your brotherly shoulder in this difficult time and for your open heart to help people in the eyes of grief, tears and pain to have encouragement, support, hope and God's participation in this difficult and cruel time. God bless you!

We thank the mission very much for the opportunity we have been given on behalf of all these people who thank us. There are more than 1,000 migrants in the city, except for those in nearby villages. A lot of people come. From the most diverse parts of Ukraine, in particular from the infamous Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, and even from Mariupol, which escaped from there. Food, hygiene products are a vital necessity for people who have lost their homes, jobs, and their usual way of life has changed dramatically. At the beginning of the war, local authorities partially helped people when there were not so many of them. Now in our church the main point of help for IDPs, if not for your financial help, we would not be able to help, because those resources that were not enough to cover such a large number of people! We try to help with food more if people ask for help with medicine, we buy medicine, sometimes with shoes, clothes, because someone escaped from the bomb shelters and could not take anything with them ... People are very grateful, bless, wish not to experience what happened to them. And everyone dreams that it will end ... It was written to me by a woman. Good afternoon! Our family is from Kharkov, we are 5 people. We are very grateful to the kind people who sheltered us and to you for helping us with our products. We left Kharkov on March 4 and arrived on March 8. Assistance to migrants is not yet paid, so your help is invaluable to us! Thank you so much for taking care of us!

Hello The Samaritan's Purse! My name is Serhii Mahda. I the pastor of the church received the money from you. Thank you very much for the supporting our ministry. We haven't spent all the money, we try  save it and spend it wisely.  We've allready spent some amount of money for buying food for packing the food kits for the refugees, and some members of the church who lost the job and the sourse of income. Some of the money had been spent for buying gas for delivering the food. I attach some photo of spreading away the food kits. Thank you guys! God bless you! God bless America!

 brief description of how much money is needed: We help people, children with diapers and other things, there are also widows, single people who need medicine and food. We deal with adolescents and children who are low-income. Also for the needs of church members are family and elderly people. Devi families were evacuated, and migrants were also received. Three families need help with many children, one of the families was happy when we helped with food, bought baby food. They lost their house, so they need a lot. Unfortunately, we can't help everyone. But with your participation, we serve people and give joy. Thank God for everything! One woman was not able to buy medicine, so we decided to buy it and told her that God had blessed us with the mission. She did not expect such help. She is very grateful that you supported her with your participation. We will also hold a children's camp. Thank you very much and thank God for everything!

Funds from the Samaritan's Bag helped our church a lot. During the occupation of the Sumy region, we used these funds to buy medicine for members and parishioners of our church, as well as neighboring churches and residents of villages in the region and the city of Romny, in particular. They bought bread and cereals and distributed them to people who had no food. We packed small kits with household chemicals and hygiene products. They also paid for the delivery of humanitarian aid from the western regions of Ukraine and the delivery of humanitarian aid from the western border of Ukraine to Sumy region. Paid for fuel for delivery. Humanitarian aid was taken to Okhtyrka and Trostyanets several times. These settlements have suffered greatly from Russian aggression. At Easter, additional food kits were made and distributed to socially vulnerable families in the Romny region. Now we continue to help the residents of Sumy region, and also accept migrants from the southern regions of Ukraine. During this time, our church has grown significantly. A lot of new people are coming. There is not enough space for everyone in the hall where we used to gather. Thank God! And many thanks to you for your help and care for us and our country! Be blessed!

Thank God. I greet you with the love of our Lord. We truly thank you for this help, in this difficult time for Ukraine, you have blessed us greatly, we were able to share these funds with others. We prepared food bags in those hot spots where there was what to eat, for those who defend our Ukraine we prepare dinner and bake various delicacies, at the same time show our love and as the Bible says: "Be a light to the world". Many people flee the war, leaving their homes, and we fed them and them blessed. Because of our and your work, people repent and come to the meeting, for which we truly thank you. "Give and give to you; with a good measure, trampled, shaken and overflowing, they will give you a waist. For as much as you measure, so you are measured." Luke 6:38

<p>
Congratulations friends! We have been convinced for many times that true friends are friends in need, and true service continues even when it is difficult to serve! As a local church, we are very grateful to you for your prayers and financial support. Thanks to your support, we were able to take care of many people who fled the war. We transported many tons of food to the right places and medicines, evacuated and settled dozens of families. We were able to help our friends buy firewood, where many people from the east of our country live. We feel your support and are grateful to you. May the Lord reward you for the good you do for us in this difficult time!

Our church was able to settle more than 160 people who came from the war zone in the cities and villages of our district, caring for them and giving them everything they need to live. We also had many trips to the hot spots of our country with provisions, ie food and groceries. Also, with your help, they brought food at the last moment, when people had nothing to eat and who did not eat bread for a month. Therefore, thank you very much for your great help.

The Church of Boguslaw is very grateful to the Samaritan Sum for financial assistance. We received funds from you at a time when fighting was taking place in the Kiev region. We were able to buy fuel for them and arrange the delivery of food and medicine. Our volunteers took food and medicine to the following cities: Gostomel, Bucha, Irpin, Ivankovichi, Makariv. A certain number of people from Kyiv region were able to evacuate to the border with Poland. Some low-income families from our city also provided food kits. In addition, we cooperated with the Bila Tserkva group of volunteers "Good Heart" and shared with them fuel for trips to Berdyansk and Mykolaiv region. The vast majority of funds went to purchase fuel for beads, medicines and food. Thank you very much for your tremendous contribution to supporting the people of Ukraine. We pray for peace and for your team. Thank you !!! ????

Now Novoosinove is in the temporarily occupied territory, there is no communication, light, water, lack of medicines and hygiene products, very expensive products. Thanks to your help, we were able to miraculously bring medicine, hygiene products, and money to buy food. We also help displaced people who have left their homes. In the photo, we conducted services in two cities in one camp for about 200 people from different regions of the east, in the other 45 who came from Kharkiv and spent 25 days in a bomb shelter. Thanks to your support, we were able to provide them with food and medicine for a certain period of time. May the Lord abundantly bless all who are involved!

Thanks to the help of the Samaritan Bag Mission, many people were able to experience God's love and mercy in their absence. With the help of these finances, food was purchased, and every day our chefs cook for 200 people. Thank the Lord and you.

We thank the Samaritan Bag for significant help to our church. Thanks to your funds, we are able to buy food, prepare food, feed refugees and residents of the city of Kherson who are under occupation. We will also be able to continue to support our citizens in these difficult times by purchasing cereals, bread, vegetables and everything they need. We are currently negotiating the purchase of beds, mattresses and bed linen so that people can have decent conditions for a temporary stay in the basement of our church, which serves as a bomb shelter for people and their children during the war. Thanks to you, we can also now pay large utility bills, including the use of large quantities of water and electricity used for lighting and space heating. Thank you for everything! May our Heavenly Father bless your mission and protect you and your families! May the Lord bless you abundantly! You are special! Thank you very much! Hold on and believe in victory!

We are grateful to the Lord and to you for this help and support for our ministry in Ukraine. Were it not for this help, I am afraid we would not have the means to serve the needy, the refugees, and the children of our area. Today is a very difficult and stressful life in Ukraine. We are grateful to God that He did not leave us even in this difficult time. Personally, our mission station now serves to receive refugees for overnight stays and to live in our house of prayer. And also in the delivery of humanitarian aid to the east of Ukraine, where districts and villages are now overcrowded with internally displaced persons. With the money you donate, we can cover fuel, which is now catastrophically expensive, to deliver aid to those churches that are in dire need of humanitarianism and unable to cover fuel costs. Funding for the needs of refugees in our house of prayer is also included here. The expenses of serving the children and adolescents who regularly attend our Sunday school are covered by the finances that God has blessed us with through your generous heart. We were able to help one needy family to buy spring children's clothes. Thank God and you that we have the opportunity to have and give to others. Bless you.

The Church sincerely thanks for the funds provided, thanks to which we were able to do good in the name of the Almighty, feed the hungry, actively helping food to refugees, displaced persons. All members of the small local church stews and pate in autoclaves. Semi-finished products of dumplings, pelmeni, pancakes, banderyks were made. Various confectionery was baked. Labor days were hard and full, but we were glad that we did work in the name of the Lord. We express our sincere gratitude to all the benefactors of the funds. May the good done by you, God return to you a hundredfold.

Many thanks to the Lord for you and your sacrifice. On behalf of our church, I thank everyone for this financial assistance that allows us to serve refugees effectively. We spent the money to help refugees - in particular to provide them with housing, food, transportation, assistance in the form of clothing, footwear, medicines, food kits. May God reward you for the resources and efforts you have made for Ukrainians during this war!

With the funds of $ 5,000 sent to the namb, food was purchased and 200 food kits were formed in cardboard boxes, which we distributed to the families of temporarily displaced persons (refugees). Some of the funds were transferred to several religious communities (churches) that provided housing and food to refugees. The rest of the funds were spent to cover the costs of transporting refugees who lost their homes, as well as refugees from the places of hostilities to the western border of Ukraine. We express our sincere, heartfelt gratitude to you for your significant help and participation in our service to the Ukrainian people. Your true Christian love and sacrifice are very valuable to us.

The Church helps people with food in the Russian-occupied village of Donskoye, where the Church is registered. who left the city of Volnovakha, Donetsk region, the city of Dnipro and the city of Kharkiv. And the most important thing is that the Gospel was sown in people's lives, which people willingly accepted. All the people who received help are very grateful for the timely help, some of them cried that they are not abandoned and not alone, but care for them. Thank you for being you!

Dear partners, we truly thank you for your help and financial support. Thanks to your funds, 100 food packages were purchased and formed. I don't know exactly where these food will go, because they were taken by volunteers, maybe to Chernihiv region, and maybe to Kherson region, but if someone can satisfy hunger and not die, it will be a small victory of light over darkness, life over death .

Church HVEP s. Young. Our meeting with Svitlana's family from near Kyiv happened by accident, but I believe it was necessary, because this family really needed help. The unfortunate people were waiting for the explosions in their house, but when the house across the street was destroyed, they realized they had to flee. After waiting another 2 days at a dacha in the woods, the family decided to go to western Ukraine, taking their friends and their children with them on the way. With tears in her eyes, Svetlana told how before the Russian invasion she opened her veterinary shop, paid off the last debts and delivered the goods, but in an instant all the plans and dreams were ruined by the war. The man brought them to a man who offered them shelter, and he returned to Kyiv region. Svetlana cried in despair and told her that she did not know where they would return, because the roof of the house had been raised several times due to the explosions, and it is unknown whether it will survive. These people desperately wanted to escape and therefore did not even take with them the most necessary things, sorry for the details, but one boy did not even have to change underwear, and clothes were already dirty - no other in them For these two families were purchased: food, bowls, buckets, powders, personal hygiene products, for children - stationery, diapers, chocolate and linen. Another small help was the purchase of products, which will later be sorted and sent to Chernihiv region. Thank you so much for your help, you have no idea what it feels like to know that you are not alone and to be able to help others.

The war was a test and a challenge for many in our country. Our local church, like many other churches, never stood aside when there was a need to help, serve, care for the needs of others. Our city is an important railway junction, through which many evacuation trains pass, we met people, fed, helped with settlement, treatment, registration or further transportation to the border with Poland. A part of the prayer house was set up for the accommodation of the settlers, and some other rooms were set up for the same purpose. Completed and sent transport with the necessary things to Chernihiv and Severodonetsk. The funds received from the Samaritan's Bag were of great help in these matters.

The church used the proceeds to evacuate people. Three buses took people out of Kyiv and Kyiv region during the month. Our brothers brought humanitarian aid abroad to Kyiv and Sumy regions. 280 people came to our area with children, helped with clothes, bedding, food, provided housing and firewood, as not every home has gas, some children come to Sunday school. Recently we brought food, household chemicals and clothes again Chernihiv region Snovsk border zone with Belarus. Thank God we can work. Our sisters for the military sewed thermal underwear, hats, gloves, unloading. Thank you for the finances we used them in the name of Jesus Christ.

The Church of Ruth thanks the Lord for helping the Samaritan Bag financially. Because of this, we were able to serve the brothers and sisters of the church and the people of Kharkiv. With these funds we bought food, the residents of Kharkiv, especially those in need, held children's camps for refugees from Kharkiv region. The team of volunteers transported refugees and passed on the Gospel to many people, which we believe will surely heal their hearts and give them the strength to overcome difficulties in these difficult times. Personally, listening to everyone's story, my heart breaks with pain for those people who have learned the great grief brought to our Ukraine by the "Russian world". And I want to share one of these stories with you. Anatoly, the so-called new acquaintance of mine, lost his leg and hearing from an enemy shell explosion that was dropped in a residential area near the ATB. The story of this terrible tragedy, said his wife Anatoly, because he completely stopped hearing. "On February 24, the war began and time stopped for every Ukrainian. People began to leave the city. However, we are already old and did not have the opportunity to leave, so we stayed put. Between shelling and bombing, we periodically left the house to buy bread and food. That's how on March 12 Anatoly went to the store to buy bread and find out about possible humanitarian aid. And after a while, when he came out, there was a loud explosion near our house. It seemed that the house would be built in an instant. At that time, I realized that the rocket hit somewhere very close. And there was only one prayer to God, so that nothing would happen to my Tolik. One hour passed ... two ... three ... and he was gone. I couldn't find a place for myself, because my heart felt that something had happened to my husband. I don't even know how I survived that night. It seemed like an eternity. And as soon as morning came, I started calling all the city hospitals, looking for him. He was in the 17th hospital, where his leg was amputated. During that terrible explosion I heard, my husband received shrapnel wounds. His leg was torn to pieces and one of the fragments pierced the side of his abdomen, but thank God that the wound was not fatal! He cried out in pain and cried for help. And one family, seeing him, took him to the military, who provided first aid and took him to the hospital. Doctors made every effort, however, and could not save his leg. Later, as it turned out, Anatoly lost his hearing. He was in the hospital for a month. And when he was discharged, I could not recognize my Tolik in him. He was like that "budulai" and completely gray. Now we have moved to a private house, which is located near our apartment. Good people helped us a lot. But my Anatoly does not lose hope and dream that very soon, thanks to the necessary prosthesis and hearing aid, he will be able to walk and hear again, and I thank the volunteers of the Church of Rufus who help us with food and support us financially and spiritually. " like our Anatoly and Valentine very much, therefore, our church is infinitely grateful to the Lord for your sacrifice, and that you and I have been able to share this pain with these people and comfort them with the Word of the Lord by transmitting the Gospel through us!

HUMANITY EXAM My dear friends! We had to live in a crucial time. Right now, each of us is doing a very important thing in our place. And we are all working together for our victory. Until recently, our charitable kitchen-dining room provided the necessary food for those people whom we used to call the least socially protected categories of the population. Our visitors were mostly single elderly people, large families, people with disabilities. But the war changed everything. Now, those who were never considered poor were often left homeless, and those who never ran out of bread sometimes ate nothing for several days. And now we, as Ukrainians, as Christians, help each other. And we, as a parish, as a Beryslav community, are doing what we can to help those in need. Each of us today is taking an exam for humanity, for authenticity, for patriotism. Hundreds of people who want to eat come to our doors every day. And we thank God that we can serve them and have the opportunity to help. In the last two weeks, 1,721 people received ready meals in our canteen. And the dining room itself has now become, without exaggeration, a refectory church, because it operates within the painted walls of our Berislav shrine. I bow low to all our compatriots who tirelessly serve on this front of love - cooks, volunteers, benefactors and donors. Your help is invaluable! I want to bend down and kiss your hands, which, despite the fatigue, find, prepare and distribute all that we treat our visitors. Thanks to our partners Samaritan's Purse International Relief, who found the funds to purchase products. I am proud of you, dear compatriots! May the Lord generously bless each and every one of you! PS Our kitchen is open daily at 1 p.m.

For us, as a gypsy community, this is a great help, because the lives of people of Roma origin before the war were very difficult, but because our country is at war with Russia, the fate of these people has become even more difficult. Your help is a way out for more families, because you saved 200 families from starvation! Thank you very much and we are grateful for your help! We wish you a blessing from our God!

Here is what Ivanka, a girl who came from Mykolayiv, has to say: “Today I once again realized that God still exists, I always knew that people could help, but I never imagined that they were ready to serve like this. We traveled for two days and were accompanied by believers everywhere. I am thankful to God that there are those who sacrifice "

Thank God! The funds provided from the Samaritan's Bag during the difficult times of the war with Russia helped our church very much. We thank the Samaritan Bag project for the opportunity to bring goodness, hope, and faith in change. With these funds we: - bought food (buckwheat, rice, millet, barley groats, sunflower oil, flour, sugar, pasta, pate); - bought medicines; - provided evacuation assistance. Many thanks to the Samaritan Bag project for providing financial assistance to the people. We hope that with God's help the war will end soon, everyone will return home and peace will come! God's blessing to all and thank you very much for the help that people so desperately need.

We were able to support and bypass the people of migrants, refugees, the families of those who went to defend our country, their mothers, as well as elderly single people and the poor, those who needed support. We thank you that these funds fed people who needed food, provided housing services, household and other needs. They also supported a cancer patient. We helped families fleeing Borodyanka, Irpin and Kyiv. We have witnessed many and invited people to come to us with their needs. We are grateful that some of these people joined the Easter holiday and invited friends. Natasha and Taras with their two children told how miraculously God saved them when they fled from Borodyanka, how they asked for bread with an outstretched hand, and there was nothing to eat, as children asked to eat and there was no food. We have prayed for this family, and we thank God for our response. Through these funds, we have the opportunity to serve others. Thank the Lord and you, may God bless your service, your sacrifice.

Our Church of the Pentecostal Evangelical Christians v. Molodavo also joined the organization of assistance to the people of Chernihiv, amounting to 100 food packages. The realities of our time are that we are currently at war on two fronts: our brave warriors are defending the Ukrainian land from Russian invasion, and we, ordinary people, are helping to fight hunger and destruction. Every woven camouflage net, every loaf of bread, every donated hryvnia is another step towards freedom and peace. Apparently, each of us could never have imagined that in our time, in a prosperous, fertile Ukraine, the word "famine" will be heard, in Ethiopia, North Korea, Haiti, yes, maybe, but not here. And if our help can make someone full and save from hunger, it will be our little victory - mercy over poverty, light over darkness. The Bible says, "He that hath a good eye shall be blessed: for he giveth unto the poor of his bread" (Proverbs 22: 9).

With your support, we were able to hold mass celebrations for the children of migrants in the villages and towns of our region. They had various master classes, curiosities, sports grounds and gifts. They also made food packages and distributed them to migrants living in Zdolbuniv region. Parents and children are incredibly grateful for the powerful help in this difficult time for them. Beads of food packages were also procured and delivered to villages liberated from Russian occupation. Thank you very much to God and to you for your financial help.

Now there is a great need for baby food and diapers for little Ukrainians. I have already heard from several mothers that the children went to the potty, but after moving - they stopped. Stress in the subconscious so affected. So diapers are very necessary, and they are expensive. So we help the kids.

People have not received any payments for two months of war! They come to us all the time: who needs detergent, who needs powder, who needs potatoes, who needs diapers, who needs flour, who needs things ... I give something to someone who is over. Today I bought people a set of bedding and towels.

<p>
Our village is a suburb of Zaporizhia, where people from the occupied territories have been fleeing in recent months. Our village was no exception, there were many new families who came without anything, who lost everything, and who were separated by war. When the war broke out, the only thing the church ministers wanted was not to miss the tremendous opportunity to get in touch with the locals, to support them, to calm them down, to remind them of really important things, to "tune in to the heavenly wave." God saw this desire, blessed the Samaritan with his bag, brought him to the right social worker, and led him. Social worker only after personal acquaintance - began to give contacts to families in need. At the moment there are more than 60 of them. Families are different ... some barely make ends meet, some are left without the help of relatives, some were uncomfortable taking help, some kissing the Bible, saying God loves us and has not forgotten, some are looking forward to leaving soon to finally reveal gift and package and see what is there, someone shares the pain that the child is not baptized in childhood and asks how to live with it further, someone cautiously begins to smile, someone asks for more "supplements", someone can not believe that help just like that and in return nothing should be given, someone at first refuses to take, thinking that there is some trick in it, someone in ten minutes has time to open his soul. Emotions are positive, sincere gratitude is felt, openness to listen to the Word of God! It is clear that people will not immediately repent for a piece of bread, but the reputation of the church, acquaintance with its light and good deeds - will bear fruit. We also financially helped several families to leave the war zone. Someone stayed in our village, one family with 2 small children was helped to travel to Western Ukraine and find housing there. They took care of our grandparents in our village, who were left alone because their families went to safer places and countries. We did not ignore the children with cancer in our city, those who are in hospital and continue to stay there, unable to leave. We bless them with sweet and fruity sets as well as Samaritan Bag gifts. In total, during the week we managed to financially or productively support 10-15 families with children, 8-10 grandparents, once a month children with cancer, and 50+ children in Yuliivka. The pastor of the church, Kostenko Oleksandr, says: 'Personally, I am happy that helping people in this way - the church library emptied the Bible, the New Testament. It is possible to see people who do not have it at all and finally understand the attitude of people towards God '. Larysa Bykova, director of the Julius House of Culture (with whom we worked before the war) writes: 'Good evening! We are from Ukraine! Thank you very much! I announced to the children that you will come to us for Easter, that you have collected gifts. The answer was stunning. "No need for gifts, better let them come to play together, drink tea." Yuliivka is a village outside the city of Zaporizhia, not occupied, but flew in several times. Located 20 km from the city, but the village is a village. There are several streets, everyone knows each other, everyone is scared, but almost no one left, because there is nowhere. There are 54 children in Yuliivka, so they were blessed with food, medicine and gifts. Almost every family ends the conversation with the phrase 'Thank God'. We are trying to continue working with them, looking for new ways to provide humanitarian and financial assistance, and to support these families. Thank God! May the Lord abundantly bless those who sponsor these good works.

Peace to you! We greet you with the love of the Lord Jesus Christ! We thank Christ for your location, through your participation in helping people and the church who suffered from the hostilities in the Luhansk region. These funds were used to evacuate people, and food packages for people who remained in the city of Lysychansk, as well as for migrants from the Luhansk region, and partly from the Donetsk region, and the purchase of medicines. The following products were purchased: Pasta, bread, sugar, cereals, sunflower oil and much more. Also, there is no electricity in the city of Lisichansk, and for charging phones and cooking on electric stoves, gasoline was purchased for a 40-liter A-92 generator. In the city of Shepetovka, Khmelnytsky region, 30 displaced persons live in the church, and there is not enough food because the church prepares sandwiches for people who travel by evacuation train, and we decided to help this church at the fraternal council, since they once received our church members and placed and provided warmth and comfort. I have never seen or met the pastor of the Shepetivka church, but he received 9 people from our church and 2 of them are my wife and pregnant sister... I am very grateful to God for such brothers and sisters who did not stand aside and helped our members churches in difficult times… God gives opportunities to serve people, and we were able to help 450 families with food, bring 55 people out of them 6 disabled people, 10 children, and also help 1 person in an operation, bring water to 60 families who were left without water in the city. Many thanks to you all and blessings from our Lord. May God supply all your needs. With love Church of the Transfiguration. Sincerely, the minister of the church Alexander Cherneta

The funds received from the Samaritan's Bag were used to support families in which men are defending our state, refugee families, families in difficult life circumstances. The families were provided with material assistance in the form of food kits, including flour, sugar, oil, etc. Each child received a gift from the Samaritan Bag, which was a testament to Jesus' concern for the children as well. We believe that the help provided by the organization will help make people's hearts more open to the Word of God. Families with tears thanked God and Christians for not leaving them alone and supporting them in this difficult time for their family and Ukraine.

When the war started, it was difficult to describe the experience, because it had never happened before. We prayed that the funds would be directed correctly. They had the opportunity to bless people of retirement age so that they could pay for apartments. Our church also serves with drug addicts. There is a third stage in this ministry, when a person goes to work and lives together in an apartment. This means that we teach them to socially adapt to society. During the war, they lost their jobs and had nothing to pay for the apartments they rented. We have three such apartments. They also gave a certain amount to families who also needed financial support due to losing their jobs due to the war. It is impossible to describe in words what people experienced when they were blessed with money. People cried and everyone said…. God thank you! I knew, I knew you wouldn't leave. We thank all the people who served our church with financial support. Praise our God!

<p>
Good afternoon, very grateful to the Samaritan Sumy, that at such an unfortunate time for the Ukrainian people, you did not stay aside, but indeed, as our Lord taught us, you came to the aid and support of the local churches of Ukraine. Thanks to this help, we were able to do much more good deeds and in turn support the needy. In the first days of the war, our church helped evacuate people to western Ukraine and European countries. We also took mothers with children, the sick and elderly parishioners from our church out of the city. And they left only men and those who did not want to leave Zhytomyr and stayed to work with us on the spot. When people were taken west, they in turn arranged for a humanitarian and took them back with luggage to help those in need. Already in March, we began to deal with the families of migrants in our area. They were helped with food, hygiene items and clothing, as many of them simply left the bomb shelters without even being able to go home to pick up their belongings. Most of them were people from Irpin, Bucha and Borodyanka, who did not want to go far, so they came to Zhytomyr and many to Korostyshiv. That's why we went every day and gave them, first of all, the necessary things for life, as well as offered them communication. You know, during this time we saw how the Lord works in the hearts of Ukrainians, so many of them listened to the Gospel of the grace of God's salvation. It was a very joyful time for us, and when you read the news or see what is happening somewhere, there are only tears in your eyes and tightness in your chest, but the Lord has given us comfort, inspiration and hope through this work. We took care of the families of the migrants all March. And when the Kyiv regions were liberated from occupation, we have been paying more attention to trips there since the beginning of April. The closest region to us is Makariv district. There people have been under occupation for a whole month and there are villages where half of the village is completely destroyed, somewhere not so much, but people all suffered morally, many physically. Many different organizations came here and abroad to help, but people needed more moral and spiritual support. So my brothers and sisters and I went there almost every day for the first two weeks, and then several times a week. There are already people there who are always waiting for our arrival to listen to the word of God. We even try to get them to eat, so we prepare and bring with us some delicious homemade dishes, or pies and dumplings, because we see how difficult it is for them still morally. They are exhausted and even many of them do not want to eat, let alone cook something delicious. Therefore, with our support we want to show them that someone needs them, and most importantly they are precious to our Lord. In parallel, we are working with centers for migrants, preparing programs for children, showing a film about the birth and death of Jesus to parents and preaching the Gospel to all. Thank you very much for meeting you and for such timely support. In fact, now more than half of the church is not in the city, but the remaining few still work, so with the support of the Samaritan Bag could freely spend money on food and industrial goods, and a lot of money was needed for fuel to travel to other regions, and especially the evacuation of people. Thank you very much, Lord, for you !!!

Our church used the money to buy food and distribute it to needy people, large families, the elderly, those who have lost their jobs and church members. For us, this is an opportunity not only to distribute food, but also to convey God's gospel to them, and to show God's love for these people. We would like to share one of the testimonies: "Good afternoon! My name is Anna, I'm from Kherson. I live with my mother, she is 70 years old, she is disabled. Since the beginning of the war my mother's pension was withheld and I lost my job. , we didn't have enough money for food, but thank God you helped me a lot with the food. Thank you very much. " We thank God and the Samaritan Bag Mission for the opportunity to serve the unbelievers and their people in the Church at this difficult time.

Not a quiet time has come to the Donbass. It became impossible to continue living a normal life. The sound of exploding shells alone is terrifying. And when it comes to young people, children who still have to live and live, you have to make a choice and look for a more peaceful place. So it was decided with these young people. Most of them are relatives. But among them there is one guy, a teenager, Yaroslav, who can be called an orphan with living parents. Each of them lives his own life, separately from each other, and Yaroslav lives his own. There is no one to take care of him. They were evacuated to Transcarpathia, in one of the villages they found an old house where no one had lived for a long time, they cleaned it, repaired the water supply, gas column, kind people helped whoever they could and the guys settled down. Glory to the Lord and gratitude to people for compassion and care. The local church supports food and is always there.

For seven years now, a team of missionaries has been serving in the villages on the front line. Preaching the Gospel, helping people living in depressed areas of the Donetsk region. With the advent of the active phase of hostilities, the situation deteriorated sharply. Many people have evacuated to safer places. Other people remained where they were. It’s a pity for them to leave their old, but native housing, and there’s really nowhere to go. So we continue to visit these people with food assistance. We meet, hug, pray for them and expect peace. We are very grateful to all not indifferent people who support us in this ministry. God bless you.

It became very difficult in the front-line settlements. Shops closed, no water, no medicines. People who have made the decision to stay put have to literally survive. Our team delivers humanitarian aid to these villages in the form of food, water, hygiene and medicines. It is an indescribable joy to see the faces of people receiving hope for life. Accepting with gratitude, they understand that not everything is lost in this world, there are people who can not sleep when others are malnourished, there are those who think about them. We thank all the donors, your work is not in vain.

From the line of demarcation in the Donbass, we take families with small children to western Ukraine. The journey is so long that it takes two days. We stopped for the night at the house of prayer. After a warm welcome, sleep and breakfast, we set off again. They have never traveled this far before. Tired but happy to be in relative safety, the children patiently waited for the end of the journey. Some women were also brought medicines necessary to maintain health. Now it is almost impossible to buy them there, pharmacies are closed. Let's do good together. Thank you for not indifferent people.

Evacuation from the Donetsk region of a shelter for the elderly. 21 people were evacuated to Ivano-Frankivsk region. Elderly women, some in wheelchairs, others with disabilities, and still others lying down. But when the front line approached tightly to their village, it was impossible to stay there. People were taken out together with the staff, temporarily settled in a camp site and we provide all possible assistance with food, hygiene and so on. These people need special care and it is nice to be a witness of how Christians can serve their neighbor. Thanks to all benefactors

It's been hard for me to do reports lately without tears. So many people crippled by the war ... day after day I see dozens of people crying as they see food that blesses and prays for people who care about the plight of our people ... the mission saved many lives from starvation and cold. I am infinitely glad that God is entrusting us with the resources to sustain human destinies. Glory to Him! Thank you! :)

Congratulations dear brothers and sisters! In the last 2.5 months, we have experienced several bombings in the city of Korosten. From the first day of the war, the brothers and sisters of the church volunteered to support not only the population but also the defenders. When your donation came, we had a big problem with transportation, and that money was God's answer. While we were looking for transport, we still delivered humanitarian aid to the residents of the affected areas and villages, pensioners and displaced persons. So far, more than 30 tons of hygiene products and supplies have been distributed to the local population alone. We also made the children happy when we had the opportunity to give them gifts from the "Christmas Child" program. And finally, the main thing is that we bought transport and now we can move between settlements to transport not only humanitarian aid, but also people. The funds have greatly supported us in purchasing fuel and food. Thank you for your support and for your sensitive heart! It is very important! We feel that we are doing what pleases God.

Congratulations to all project partners! We work in all directions! - Help the needy! -Help to those who were evacuated. -Help to those who are in the occupation of Shostka, Romny, Chuguiv, Kherson, Odesa ... - We give gifts to children who were evacuated from Sumy and Kharkiv! We are very grateful for the strong support, which gives us the opportunity to involve more people in volunteer work. A little evidence: we were approached by the Regional Department of Health with a request to refuel the Children's Resuscitation Vehicle. They have refueling coupons in the Marshall Network. but these gas stations were closed and the office in Kharkiv was bombed. we are twice per 100 liters. fuel refueled them! This made it possible to transport operable children from the occupied territories! We are constantly helping the regional children's hospital! Funds for the purchase of food for children. We help people in the war zone and in the liberated territories! We are very happy and grateful for your help and cooperation!

Because of the war, many people were left without homes and money. In our church they were able to find the necessary humanitarian aid and a hot lunch. Also, our guys in the hot spots will not be left without God's support: food, water, the necessary means to fight. You always need money for gasoline or diesel fuel. Thank you that many people have experienced God's love and care through you.

Praise the Lord that He cares for everyone! That, because of you, sends help! From March 26, 2022, two people from Mariupol and one from Kyiv live in our house. They were forced to leave their cities due to the war. We are glad that they have found shelter in our house and we are able to provide them with food and everything they need. In addition to this, we can visit different places where children - immigrants live with their parents. We were able to be in three different institutions. Together with delicious treats we share the Good News for all who come to such meetings.

Thanks to the funds our church received from the Samaritan's Bag, we were able to financially support 2 families who were evacuated from "hot spots" without means of subsistence. Food kits were purchased for refugees and socially disadvantaged families living in our area. We were also able to send food aid to the Kharkiv region at the expense of the Samaritan's Bag.

We truly thank the Samaritan Bag for the money sent. In this difficult time for all of us, you have become an incredibly powerful blessing to our church and community. Our church is located in the village of Dimer, which from the first days of the war until the beginning of April was under the occupation of the Russian army. Near our village, near the river Irpin, there were fierce battles for the city of Kyiv. Every day there lasted an eternity. But we thank God for you, for your finances, because thanks to them we were able to serve the people in the village. We were able to evacuate dozens of people from the occupied territories, including small children, and take them to safe areas and even abroad. Whenever possible, reliable people donated medicines purchased with the funds you sent. After all, there are many retirees among those who remained in the occupied territories. Among the people we could serve was my grandfather, who lost his sight during the war. We still take care of him with food and medicine. After the deoccupation, we are working to rebuild our village, purchase food kits for the community, and serve children who have suffered psychological trauma. Most of the finances go to fuel and food. If necessary, we continue to buy medicines for people, because in the village of Dimer pharmacies are just beginning to resume their work. Thank you for your timely support, thanks to you we can serve many people who suffered in this terrible war. We plan to organize children's clubs and hold children's camps in the settlements of Kyiv region affected by the war. Thanks for support!

1) Thank God for the money, many people lost their jobs - the financial situation is difficult, so we support people with products !! 2) The story through which God spoke and showed that He is strong, and cares about his own: We have a woman who goes to church, a man whose atheist) when we visited her, saw the need, the old rough with which they heat the house -almost not grill)) we offered to replace it with a new one, she agreed…. After building a new one, she told us a story: when she asked her husband to replace the rough one, he replied: -you pray to your God, let him do something else… As a result, God replaced and gave a new rough one powerful, works through their children))) 3) pleasantly shocked were the forcibly displaced people, in this time of war People turn to God even more, they see so much God's care for them, God feeds and clothes them, and most importantly God gives peace to the heart !! - says one of them… And we thank God that we are His messengers, thanks to you !!! Wishes from grandmothers: That you always had, and never asked, and could still share !!! That you were everything and there was no shortage….

<p>
On behalf of our Charitable Foundation "Hope for a New Life" and all the people who received help, we express our sincere gratitude to "Samaritan Bags" to the management and all the organizers for the financial assistance we receive. This is very important now in this very difficult time, because through such blessings we can serve even more people who have lost their homes and left the places where they were born. By helping, we get closer to complete strangers, who then become almost like a family. We also organize meetings where, in addition to receiving the necessary help, we testify to them the Word of God. It is inspiring to go further. People gladly accept the Word, we sow, and the Lord grows and uplifts. Thank the Lord that we can serve Him. And may the Lord be glorified through these works. May the Lord bless you all for your open hearts.

Thank you very much for your help. Our church is once again accepting immigrants fleeing the war. Every day in the House of Prayer there are from 10 to 30 people who are fed, given the necessary things, there are children who need children's things, as well as medical examinations and certain medications. In addition to food and things, we also bought medicine, part of the money was spent on dental services, a 12-year-old girl was braced, part of the money was donated from this project, part by church members and part paid by the dental clinic itself. Essential medicines for the wounded were also procured and transferred to a medical facility. We, as disciples of Christ, work for His Glory. We also help with moral support and testify of the Savior of the world. It is gratifying that people are taking part in glorifying our Lord in worship. Glory to our Lord.

The money we received from the Samaritan Bag made us able to serve our people in difficult times. We did not seek a one-time use of your funds, but reusable and long-term. Therefore, they were used to purchase equipment for canning (autoclaves, canning machines, tin cans, retort bags and raw materials for stews and porridges). We have already processed 3.5 tons of meat, made more than five thousand cans of porridge and stew and a lot of smoked products. All this was delivered to people in places where hostilities are taking place. You have become a great blessing for us !!! Thank you sincerely for your help !!!

<p>
We, the volunteers of the New Generation Church in Ternivka, express our gratitude to the Samaritan's Bag for providing financial assistance. These funds have become a huge support for hundreds of people in cities where hostilities are taking place. The help that you provided to our ministry was able to cover all the costs of logistics, acquisition food, hygiene products and medicines. We would like to share one of the many stories of how the financial support of your ministry influenced the lives of people in the conditions of military operations. Dmitry Kravchenko lived in Avdiivka, but due to shelling by Russian troops, he was left without an apartment, where he lived with his old mother. Both of Dmitry's legs were amputated due to diabetes. He and his mother were evacuated to a neighboring village and were left to survive without a livelihood. Our volunteers visited this family and donated humanitarian aid: food and hygiene products. Dmitry's mother was very touched by the help provided. "The most memorable were the men's tears," said volunteer Elena. Dmitry really needs prostheses now, but due to the war there are very big difficulties in order to deliver them to him. The family thanked the Samaritan Bag from the bottom of their hearts for helping them through such a difficult time.

Sincere thanks to the Samaritan Bag project for their great help. Financial support for disadvantaged people who have lost loved ones or homes is a great testament to the love of God and neighbor. On the territory of our church there are already many immigrants from different eastern regions of our state. Mostly these are people who are not believers or far from God. Thanks to such support we can help people not to lose hope, experience love and sow the seeds of faith. May the good God bless our common good deeds

Good evening! Thank you for your support. It is good that you understand us and invest in our affairs. The situation in our community is calm. We do not have military operations. From time to time we hear military planes flying by. A siren often sounds to warn us of an air alarm. We hear all the terrible things that are happening in the east of our country from people who come and from our acquaintances who live there. People come without documents, because the enemy specifically burns them. To pass the posts you need to pay money and listen to a dozen offensive words. Men are practically not released. Many people are missing. Say they were taken to enemy territory. Fighting continues in the east. Many casualties, both military and civilian. There are also soldiers from our community who have already died. Every day we have mobilization among men. They prepare people for worse times if they come. As for our work, we are doing well. There is a lot of work. Every day there are requests for help. There is now an urgent need for housing for displaced families, especially those with children. We have almost nothing to rent, everything is busy, and people are coming. Most of those who come have their homes destroyed. We continue our construction. More than 50 percent of the work has already been completed. A little more and we will be able to strengthen people. In May, we hired 12 more people. They came from a place that is now under enemy control. The aggressor hid his tanks behind their houses. We hold on! We believe in victory! We pray to God for protection and salvation! We draw strength from God! We testify to people of salvation! We try to keep in touch with children, it is often not easy to answer their questions - Why did it happen? Why was the Lord angry? Why is it so scary? It hurts everyone… Thank you for your understanding! Thank you for believing in our work and helping to save those in need. Everything will be fine! Thank you! (perhaps you have a question, write, we will be happy to answer) May the Lord thank you fully for your sacrifice, for your contribution to the lives of people thousands of miles away.

We continue to help people who have suffered from the war. Helped many people since the second day of the war. On the next day of the war, February 25, 30 people were sheltered. A week later, there were already about 400 refugees. At the same time, not forgetting about our church people who lost their jobs and food. Food packages were equipped, more than 600 packages were sold in a short time. Assistance was provided to cities that survived the humanitarian crisis, such as Kharkiv, Sloviansk, Voznesensk, Mykolaiv, Kyiv, Mariupol, and other funds were used to purchase cereals, pasta, pate, and other food and hygiene products, as well as diapers and medicines, and fuel. , and repairs. Plus the city where we serve in the spread of the Gospel Novodnistrovsk, Buchach, Brzezany, Ternopil. Work was carried out with the children of local churches, as well as with children displaced from the battlefields, where they received gifts from the Samaritan's bag. One of the areas of service that has now emerged is the service to the wounded in the hospital. 5680 people were sheltered on the base, 800+ were taken to the borders, 1500 people were taken out of the hotspots. 38 tons of rubber were delivered. We continue to help people in this difficult time for our people. A large number of women and children were evacuated, both from the battlefields and to the border with neighboring countries. Kingdom of God and help people. Thank you, and Franklin Graham, and the service of the Samaritan Bag for contributing to the victory. God's blessings to you with prayer for you Love and healing!

Thanks for the help! Thanks to these funds, our church was able to buy a fairly large batch of scarce drugs for people with thyroid problems, namely Euthyrox. These medicines are vital for people, they should be taken every day, so people were incredibly happy to address this issue, and we were able to buy food to provide, for the first time, more than 500 refugees! Thank God!!! We continue to support refugees, both materially and spiritually.

Maria lived with her parents in the village of Dolgenkoe - on the border of Donetsk and Kharkov regions. It so happened that this particular settlement became the field of fierce battles for 2 months. For the first two weeks of shelling, the villagers sat in the cellars with a faint hope that it would work out. It didn’t work out ... The village was razed to the ground, the houses burned like matches. Masha's parents barely had time to evacuate, but they did not want to travel far and remained in Slavyansk together with two families of fellow villagers. Now this small commune lives with another hope that it will not be necessary to go further. The arrival of a team of volunteers from the Samaritan's Bag mission became a real holiday for children and parents. Our children are very scared. At first they played only near the open basement, - says Yegor's mother. We all, and especially children, lack positive emotions. Thank you so much for donating this! Thanks to everyone who collected and donated such wonderful gifts!

The funds received are God's response to the needs of people inside and outside the church. After all, most were not ready for military action. Thanks to the funds received, it was possible to support people from the church - to provide the necessary food aid, to assist in the evacuation of people - to help buy fuel and food on the way. Our brothers also actively served needy and unsaved people. They bought food, medicine, baby food, hygiene products for children - diapers, for bedridden patients - diapers. As hostilities in the Brovary district were active, many villages were occupied without assistance. Our brothers were able to travel to the villages with humanitarian aid, which was purchased with funds received from the Samaritan's Bag. Sometimes, this help was the only one that people could get in remote villages. It was a great opportunity to preach the gospel, pray for the needy, and support what was needed during the war — food and medicine. Thank you very much for such help! After all, thanks to the Samaritan Bag mission, more than 500 people received the necessary help, which is very important in this difficult time for us. May God bless everyone who is involved in sowing finances in this ministry!

With the beginning of the war, the need for social service increased greatly. Because our community is on its way to western Ukraine. Namely on the border of Zhytomyr and Khmelnytsky regions. From the first days of the war, we faced an influx of refugees from Kyiv and the east of the country. Some asked to just spend the night and rest on the way to the border and some stayed until today. There were so many people that it was not possible to accommodate everyone. People even occupied the service hall and slept on the floor. Many had young children. Thank God we had stocks of food, diapers and some hygiene products. Now we have nothing. But people in need remain. And we truly thank the Lord that, through your financial support, He continues to use us to serve people. We constantly support more than thirty migrants and also local church members. People need food. Because most of them do not have enough money or opportunities to work and support themselves. As an example, the Terekhov family from Konstantinovka, Donetsk region. They are not believers, but the church welcomes them and serves them. They now attend all church services. Very attentive to God's word. Their sincerity and gratitude simply cannot be expressed in words. Photo Due to constant stress, many have chronic diseases, health problems. That's why people need medicine. Such as sister Galya in the photo. She suffers from pressure problems, diabetes as a result of ulcers. And there are often no drugs or no way to buy them. Photo Due to rising fuel prices, we have begun to spend most of our budget on refueling church vehicles. And some bought bicycles. Such as Sister Victoria. She is involved in our community with women with unwanted pregnancies. Before entering, she visited them in her car from home, delivering some aid. And now we bought her bike for this, in our opinion, important service. Photos The funds that the Lord has sent through you have enabled us to support, bless, give hope and show God's love to many who need it so badly now. With gratitude, Pastor Ruslan

Thank you very much for your financial assistance to our community. The money came at a time when it was most difficult. We live in Cherkasy region and at the end of March refugees from Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk regions began to come here en masse, before that there were already refugees from Sumy, Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. From the first days of the war, we began to actively volunteer. Our church in Cherkasy region has a Humanitarian Aid Center in the form of clothes and second-hand shoes, but they started collecting food and providing it to refugees. Many of our volunteers from the church lost their jobs, but steadily helped people with their products, served at home, helped to go abroad. But the resources ran out and that's why your money helped them pay for rent and utilities. It was God's answer to them. But we decided to spend all other funds on food. More than 700 families of various categories received food kits through our ministry. We bought products, packaged them, in cooperation with other organizations, paid for the delivery of food kits. And now the demand for products is growing. Not only migrants need help, but also local people who have lost their jobs. Other organizations working in the city have reduced the amount of assistance, so people come to our office in Cherkasy, register and are ready to wait. We also hold services for those who want to know God. It is the greatest testimony that has touched our hearts. Refugees from Sumy helped us set up a relief center and worked at this point, helping people choose the right things by giving them food packages. Then, when it was time to return home, they said goodbye with tears in their eyes, said that they would be at home as we help people and open a House of Prayer (they had never been to church before and did not know God). blessed your ministry more and generously rewarded everyone who does good deeds and multiplied what you sowed. We truly thank God for you and you for your work.

<p>
By helping people with your food kits, you meet different life situations of people. For example, one woman had 60 hryvnias in her wallet and three potatoes at home. And at that moment she was called to get help. She came with tears in her eyes and thanked me sincerely and I had the opportunity to support her in the conversation and to testify of God. One grandmother, who was in a wheelchair, was helped with food and medicine, and in the conversation we learned that because of anxiety and loneliness, she wanted to commit suicide because she could not sleep at night. At the same time, we prayed with her and now we maintain friendly relations. In our ministry there are also people who suffered from the war (refugees), they also accept help with great gratitude, thank God for your sacrifice. Elderly people (retirees) accept this help with tears in their eyes and do not believe that they are given it for free. We always hear words of gratitude and glory to the Lord. In general, now during the war, if it was not difficult for people, they became more open to talking about God. That is, it is a blessed time for believers to serve and carry the gospel to the world.

want to share one testimony of how God saves people. We prepared a package of help for a woman in need, but when she arrived she was not found at home. We were a little upset, but we thought about everything, God's will. After that, seven days later they arrived and she was at home, but it so happened that her son was chained to the bed and could not walk because of the attack. She says go to my son, we went and talked to them about life, death and the gift of God's eternal life. After her son prayed to God with a prayer of repentance and asked the Lord to forgive his sins. And as it turned out the next day, this man died, but we believe that he is with God.

The Church of Christ expresses its sincere gratitude to the Samaritan bag for its financial support. Thanks to this support, we can continue to serve our country. In the church we have opened a service and we can continue to feed people who have moved to our city, they come to meetings regularly and we have communication with them and we can treat them to a delicious dinner. We also bought again products that we pass on to soldiers and people in the east. We have assembled a team of volunteers and thanks to your support we can be the hands of God in our country. We plan to buy a big tent where we want to place in the yard of our church, and every day to receive people to feed, clothe and help everyone in need…

These funds have been very helpful in our ministry to people in great need at this time. With these funds, many internally displaced people in our church have received material support in the form of food. Part of the money went to a car for the military from our city and church. They also collected many products for Kyiv, Zaporizhia, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Served materially and with the Word! Thank you very much to the organization for providing funds!

<p>
First of all, I sincerely thank the organizers of this project. The Samaritan's bag has become a lifeline for some people during this extremely difficult time of war. I want to share this experience. One girl that a man living in Germany told me about. He found my phone number and asked me to visit her. He says bring her some food. Thanks to the Samaritan's Bag project, I picked up my groceries and left. It turned out she lives with her mother and sister. Nobody works. Mom takes care of two daughters with disabilities. This senior has shaking hands and head and because of this the whole body. The disease is similar to Patkinson. She fell ill at the age of 13 and is now 24. And she says that shaking is the least of the problems, because all her muscles hurt. It is difficult to look at it without compassion. And the younger sister is mentally ill. Due to low social assistance, they live in great difficulty. So when I brought them the food they were extremely happy. This girl told me that she needed to go to the doctor in Lviv. And there are no opportunities for such a trip. Here I offered to pay for this trip thanks to the Samaritan Bag project. Gratitude could be seen in her eyes, she thanked with tears in her eyes. On the way we talked to her and her mother. Oksana was left with the question of why the Good God is so strong, and she suffers so badly. We remembered the Good Jesus, how He died on the cross for us, and that He was victorious in this struggle. When we returned to her home. She asked to come again and help her study the Word of God. She had a hope that all was not lost. That the Lord did not die for her in vain. That's why I say the Samaritan Bag project for some is the salvation of their souls in this extremely difficult time. I would like to add that our community distributes aid in the form of food, hygiene products, clothing, etc. to all those in need. The conversation was especially memorable when a woman called and said that she was from Mariupol or could not come to you and get food. Because there is a lack of social assistance, but it is necessary to have and at the same time have small children that adults do not yet understand the problems. You will remember the joy seen in the eyes of these people forever. And although the food bags were heavy, she carried them with pleasure. We received such people from different parts of Bucha, Chernihiv, Kharkiv. One man, wiping away tears, says that he has nowhere to return because his house was destroyed in front of his eyes. At the moment I am working with the city council, which provides housing for migrants, but it is in a condition that needs minor repairs. Change the gas column, wallpaper, toilet, some furniture, but the family will be able to find shelter and have a place to live. I will not forget about the young family that left Bucha only in what they were dressed in. When they arrived in Volodymyr-Volynskyi, they settled. They gathered food with our Church and intended to take it to Bucha, but after the liberation of Bucha, the Samaritan's Bag paid for his family's travel expenses to bring food to Bucha and bring clothes and necessities to this family. Therefore, I would like to thank once again the organizers and sponsors of the Samaritan Bag on behalf of those who have received and continue to receive this much-needed assistance. Through this program, many people have come to know the love of our Savior not in word but in deed. May the Lord bless you! I can't help but share with you a special experience, because it happened before my eyes. In early March, at the beginning of the war, I asked the city council to provide me with IDPs to shelter them in the House of Prayer. I was brought a whole family that escaped from that horror. They still live with us in the House of Prayer. So I say it was in front of my eyes. In this family, two daughters are twins. I do not distinguish between them. But the parents told me that sitting in the basement under fire saw how detrimental this state of affairs affects their children. One of the daughters developed mental disorders from the explosions and they decided to run away. After a month and a half that they lived with us, the Lord helped their daughter to fully recover. However, your prayers are not in vain. The Lord hears. And we pray. And I especially see that this calamity of war prompted many to seek God in the Word of God. The brother of these girls is nine years old and is studying English. In one package from the Samaritan's Bag was the New Testament in English, a pocket-sized one you would see the joy of this boy. May God bless you for such a necessary work for the Lord!

Good day. Thank you to God and to you for the tremendous support of our organization. Thanks to the funds received, we were able to continue supporting our country's migrants from dangerous regions of Ukraine. We continue to give charity dinners, provide laundry services, offer humanitarian goods, showers, literature, hygiene products. Your funds were also used to pay utility bills. We were able to continue the reconstruction of the church premises for classes with young people and children. Plans for the construction and equipment of a hostel for 24 people for a more comfortable stay in our church have been approved. In addition, we were able to meet, make friends and support children with gifts, a program of orphans who came to our city from places where there is a war. We hold a holiday school on weekends with the children of migrants and children of our church. We cooperate with the administration of our city to coordinate assistance to people who have been forced to leave their places of residence. For a brief report on serving people, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R991GxKFfQ

Conducted an evangelistic program for the Samaritan's Bag project and distributed about 130 gifts. Food packages and personal hygiene products were also distributed to 80 families. Parents and children heard the gospel, and received spiritual and material help through this support, the love of God was manifested in a tangible form. 3.

With the funds we received, we were able to purchase food packages for non-believing families. The Fast family - a family in difficult circumstances, a fire broke out in their house, the mother of three children lost her job due to the war, so the products for them became a testimony of God's love and a means of softening hearts to receive God's word (COST - 1200 UAH ) The Ogrynevych family is a family that is going through difficult times, the grandmother takes care of three grandchildren, has a paralyzed husband who has lost his documents, so he does not receive any payments. The family has a minimum pension for their grandmother, so it is very difficult for them. After receiving the food package, the grandmother began to encourage her grandchildren to attend children's meetings to study the word of God, and sometimes she comes herself. The Lord changes hearts, and material aid serves as a tool (COST - UAH 1,200) The Ignatenko family is a young family that had to leave Kryvyi Rih after the war after a week of living in a shelter. The migrants now live in the village of Adamivka together with the girl's mother. The work is lost, they have no special stocks. After receiving the food package, they became more open, began to attend meetings held for children and adults in their village, willingly accept the word of God (COST - UAH 800) Kozodoeva Raisa - single elderly woman 82 years old, who due to health I can't go to church, very weak. The support in the form of a food package and purchased medicines encouraged her very much, she sees the hand of the Lord in material support and sincerely glorifies Him (COST - UAH 1,700)

Good day. We thank you for your support at a difficult time for us. Our church has hosted a large number of families from various hot spots in our country. Many people stopped for a while and later left. This was always the case. Many families still live in our church because they lost their homes. They are provided with housing, constantly receive food, clothing, personal hygiene products. Thank you very much for your help

In the photo, they helped Stepan, who has the status of a disabled person. We bought him products. In the photo, refugees from the Donetsk region, they settled in the village. Zuivtsi. They wanted to receive humanitarian aid from the district administration, but were disappointed because they were told it was for those living in the city. But one woman told them about us. We helped them and handed them the New Testament to everyone. They prayed for them, blessed them and they went back to the village with food. Refugees from the Kherson region. My mother's name is Madonna, she has 4 children. We bought her groceries since she now lives in the village. PETRIVTSI, and there is no humanitarian aid in the village, and she is with small children, so we bought them food. She was with us in the ministry and accepted Jesus into her heart. Thank God we are able to help such people through the money we received from the Samaritan Bag.

Dear brothers and sisters, accept the great greetings from the Ukrainian people who are sincerely grateful to you, but that you have done so much in this difficult time for each of them. Thanks to you, our church was able to serve the people. Who just live in school and no longer have any housing. We bought medicines, they are also very important now and they are almost gone. Even just the usual painkiller. There are also many people who simply accepted Christ as Lord and we had prayers for these people. I want to tell you that this is one of the most personal people who has no family and no help from the authorities, she lived without bread for several weeks and had nothing to buy. But the Lord gave mercy and with the money you sent we bought food and were able to take it away. This man was lonely at the time and there was no one to help her. But the Lord fed her and saved her, she repented, and now she is with the Lord. Call her Anna and pray that her faith grows. Because where it is now is occupied territory. And unfortunately there is a lot of such evidence, but you can't describe all of it. We truly thank you all. But we embrace you with the love of our Lord Jesus Christ Be Blessed in God. People are in dire need of medicine, but they are not necessary now, thank you for trusting us and giving us the opportunity to work in God's field.

Congratulations, brothers and sisters, I sincerely thank you for giving us to serve many people in this difficult time. At your expense we bought medicine and flour for bread. Fuel was refueled to deliver humanitarian packages. And of course they testified about Jesus Christ. Many people didn't even have bread or anything. The man was lonely and had nowhere to wait for help. So thank God that through you we were able to buy her food and she accepted Christ. There are many such cases. You have helped many people and the Lord is not late in time, so I thank you sincerely. God's blessings to you.

The Christian Church of the Evangelical Faith "Living Hope" expresses its sincere gratitude for the financial assistance provided. Thanks to this, we were able to provide charitable assistance in the form of food kits, hygiene products and medicines to families who found themselves in difficult life circumstances and difficult financial situation due to the war. These are people with disabilities, single mothers, migrants, low-income and large families, people who have lost their jobs. We also had the opportunity to go to the children living in the suburbs, tell the story of the Gospel and hand out gift boxes. We appreciate your desire to make our children's difficult lives more secure and joyful, and we look forward to continuing to work together for the benefit of those in need and to spread the gospel.

In our difficult time, every support is very important both in preaching the gospel and in helping those in need. The Samaritan's Bag project is not just friendly support, it is a huge treasure for which there are no words to express our gratitude. With tears in our eyes, we say thank God that you are! At this difficult time for Ukraine, we have been involved in volunteer assistance since the first days, many purchases have been made in the form of hygiene products, food and medicine for those who were left without a roof over their heads and had to move to safer places. Without the financial support of the Samaritan Bag project, this would not have been possible. We keep thanking God for you and remembering your families in prayer! May the good Lord Bless our Ukraine and grant peace!

We truly thank you for your cooperation and such necessary and timely assistance. Thanks to your participation, we were able to help many people in different parts of our long-suffering country. May God give you back everything you spent a hundredfold! We pray for you and sincerely thank you for your sacrifice and example of Christianity! Our brothers went to Kramatorsk, which is suffering from shelling, and brought food packages, food and basic necessities. Especially for friends who donated, we made a video in English, you can watch it at: https://youtu.be/Xxyv-01WZRA. On the way back, the brothers evacuated people from the shelling. In our church they were fed, equipped with everything necessary and sent on to a safer place. It is difficult to imagine what these people went through: our young men, our young men, carried them out of the shelling. The house was destroyed, things were destroyed. They came only with what was on them. Both they and we are sincerely grateful for your help! Without your money, it would be very difficult to help because food and fuel prices are rising and many people are out of work. We do what we can. Your finances help us do more! Thank you for your love and sacrifice! We also want to add a link to a video report about 5 teams that prepared food and helped people in Borodyanka, Bucha, Irpin and Zahalets: https://youtu.be/99H05Uj0W6o. More than once products and aid were sent to the village. Cooks https://youtu.be/cj08W0XvvCE. In Zaporozhye, where most of the evacuees are staying, also from Mariupol. https://youtu.be/-YPFg54gfWU We also work and help refugees who have stayed in our city. This is not only humanitarian aid, but also spiritual. We conduct Bible lessons with children, invite them to church, communicate with families, help with housing and accommodation. https://youtu.be/vTryaBc8OBE Thank you very much for supporting and helping to develop this ministry! May God reward you beyond measure!

In fact, it is a great blessing and help. Our village is very small. Church members are probably the poorest in the village. We were very happy to be able to help. Perhaps I will write the story of two brothers. As the war broke out, about a week later, one of them felt at night that someone was waking him up and ordering him to get up, pick up his family, and leave the house. I decided to call my brother to tell. And he replied that the same thing happened to him. They realized that God had warned them. They woke up the whole family and left. We drove about 4 km and the rocket hit their house and completely destroyed it. We hear a lot and a lot of needs.

Thanks to the help we received, our church was able to provide food for the victims in Kharkiv. We were able to load and ship a full bead of food. We also had the opportunity to provide the necessary food, clothing and hygiene products for women and children who were relocated from Chernihiv and have been living in our church for three months. They also had the opportunity to send the necessary food aid to the needy from Chernihiv.

Great help in ministry at this time. We had the opportunity to take more than 30 people home and help you cross the border, return home or settle in our area. Several times we made food packages to support families. They were able to add to the old people, the lonely and those who wandered around the city in search of where they also feed bags of food or bread.

Peace to you, dear brothers and sisters in Christ. Thanks to your sacrifice, we managed to create the most comfortable stay in one of the shelters for IDPs in Lviv. In this ministry we are working on the implementation of a comprehensive program "Child Recovery". Together with the staff of the Christian Lyceum "Living Word", we set a goal to take care of the physical, psycho-emotional, mental and spiritual needs of evacuated families with children. From the first days of the war, our educational institution became a place of temporary shelter for internally displaced persons and compatriots who left the front lines of active hostilities and went abroad. Gradually we had to buy a washing machine and dryer, freezer, shower, microwave, vacuum cleaner, iron, kettle. Thank God for sensitive hearts! Families with children found shelter in the dormitories. More than 1,000 people have taken advantage of this opportunity since March 1. People eat hot lunch; receive the necessary from clothes, means of hygiene; on a separate table families have breakfast cereals and dinners; for many, a health instructor offers a free anti-stress massage. Thanks to the literary department of the Church and the Ukrainian Bible Society, our guests have spiritual "food" for the soul (gift Bibles, children's Christian literature, booklets and manuals "Overcoming Disaster"). The evacuees receive advice from a nurse and a psychologist, talk to the chaplain or mentors about the pain, share their experiences, hear warm words of support from staff and practical advice on overcoming various social and domestic difficulties. Every day at 6 pm the pastor conducts spiritual meditations on the Word of God. Although the school continues its continuous online academic training, in order to reduce stress and adapt to new conditions for IDP children, our teachers additionally organized interesting face-to-face needlework classes, master classes, and periodic city tours. Eight IDP children are enrolled in the lyceum on the basis of free education and co-financing. The financial help from you was very timely and appropriate for Ukrainian families to feel the care of Christians around the world. Our guests are especially grateful for their first close acquaintance with God, His Word and the Church. For many, it is an invaluable experience of faith, hope and love. Pray that the mission of the Theological Institute and the Christian Lyceum of Lviv will work for the glory of God even during the war. On behalf of all recipients, we truly thank you for your financial assistance and ask you to continue to be our partners in spreading the message of salvation to people and social service. Ps We send a photo report of our activities during the war in a presentation in English. You can also see the stories of the war and the mission of the Gospel in the current environment on our official website and YouTube channel. https://www.zhyveslovo.com.ua/ https://youtube.com/channel/UC3PpAm-A5EGhZ6I4mOFm5DQ

We are infinitely grateful to the Samaritan Bag for financial support for the people of our country in such a difficult period. In our, the smallest in Ukraine, territorial community settled and fully support 180 citizens from the Eastern and central regions of our country. At the expense of the Samaritan Bag, our church purchased and distributed food, personal hygiene items, care items, and we prepare food for the people. We also pay for the second time by car (diesel fuel) to the East of the country in the city of Kramatorsk, caring people carry humanitarian aid and take people out, as well as food. It so happened that in a family living in our area who do not attend services, but the children came earlier to Sunday school, the house caught fire, destroying furniture and the house inside, in a family of four children, the mother is pregnant with the fifth. We did not stay away, we also helped by purchasing some building materials, and the brothers and sisters are repairing the house for the family. Thank you very much for your service and your good, sincere hearts, may the Lord bless you abundantly, and we will not continue to stand aside, but will serve the people, thanking you and God! God's blessings!

Thanks to the Lord and your financial support, we were able to have a picnic in nature with our teenagers for teenagers of immigrants with delicious food and an evangelistic sports program. At the end of our meeting, we gave them Samaritan gifts, which they were very pleased with. Also, part of the money was used to buy vehicles that are used to evacuate people and deliver food, medical supplies, hygiene products to the hot spots of Ukraine - Kharkov, Donetsk, Lugansk. God also made it possible to arrange food packages in the nearest villages of our city (Mulchitsy, Bilskaya Volya, Ozirtsy) for refugees, large and low-income families who are experiencing financial difficulties during the war. We told each family about our Savior, gave the Gospel and distributed Samaritan gifts to the children. May the Lord bless your ministry in a special way and reward everyone 100 times for your generous hearts at this difficult time for all of us!

Absolutely unique family from Lisichansk! The photo shows only a small part of them. One woman, about 56 years old, adopted 10 orphans, forming a Family Type Orphanage (in Ukrainian, DBST). Also, her two adult daughters took 10 children each. In total, 32 people came to us (my husband and his elders stayed in Lisichansk). These wise women managed in difficult circumstances, without water, to keep smart and clean children. We were glad to serve them, giving comfort, care and food for a short time while they were with us in the Church of the Ark of Salvation. We gave them three sets of toys from the Samaritan's Bag, and two sets of stationery. Thanks to your mission for financial assistance for our common work in God's work.

The children of Lydia Petrovna Lukyanova were evacuated some time ago. She is 83 years old and for a long time she did not want to leave Kramatorsk. Until the rocket flew right into her block! We helped her with the evacuation, but then a difficulty arose: Lidia Petrovna's mobile phone broke before leaving. We urgently bought her an inexpensive used "grandmother's phone", half of the cost of which was compensated from the funds of the Samaritan's Bag. Now an elderly woman will be able to contact her children and will not get lost when the train arrives in Lviv.

 team of ministers evacuated people from the areas where the fighting took place. We also bought and distributed food kits to those who stayed in Ukraine and could not buy basic necessities. In addition, part of the funds was donated to a woman who is raising two adopted children and lost her home during the war. This woman made repairs in the rented apartment and bought the necessary things for her family's life. After all, they could not take things or clothes with them - they only took documents. Because they had only 7 minutes to evacuate.

Dear friends of the "Samaritan's Bag" mission, Thank you very much for caring for Ukraine, and in particular for the Novohrad-Volynskyi district in the Zhytomyr region, and for the financial assistance we have received and are helping people. Among them are temporarily resettled, those who are currently hardest - single, as well as those who have temporarily lost their jobs. So far, 28 families have received food kits and cash benefits. We also distributed gift boxes to IDP children, local children and New Testaments. In particular, it is in the villages of our district: Masters, Aneta, Pylypovychi, Yarun, Pischiv and others. Thank you very much, God's blessings! S / n Pastor Victor

In the process of evacuating Kramatorchan, we had to contact by phone more than five hundred people. Of these, 80 are disabled and their attendants. Sometimes one call lasted up to half an hour. Some approvals required up to ten calls. We had three employees on the hotline. Mobile phone bills have skyrocketed. Thanks to Samaritan's Bag for getting us through this period without financial problems. Note: The disabled list is deliberately vague to avoid the disclosure of personal information.

Here, in the church "The Ark of Salvation", Bishop Anatoly Ivanovich Beskrovny asked to organize a temporary center for refugees. Initially, it was intended for believers from Severodonetsk, Lisichansk, and Rubizhne. But many unbelievers came with believers. They often had children with them. It was a very interesting time! People took a moral break from shelling in the pleasant family atmosphere of the church. They ate, slept, and then moved on. It gave us great pleasure to serve them. It was especially nice to give gifts to children from the Bag of the Samaritan.

The funds received from the Samaritan's Bag during the difficult times of the war helped to buy food, medicine for the evacuees, as well as for the families who received the evacuees. The church used its vehicles to evacuate people from Kyiv, Chernihiv and Donetsk regions. She bought medicines and products and brought them to the village. Katyuzhanka, Kyiv region The evacuees were transported to serve by church transport. Some people from Kyiv and other regional centers liberated from occupation are already returning home (where possible). Thank you to all who are involved in this work of charity through the Samaritan Bag. We bless you in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We believe that this good seed, sown by joint efforts, will bear good fruit for the Kingdom of God, and a bountiful dinner in the field of those who sow. The percentage of the harvest and the reward will be determined by the Lord of the harvest. May those who scattered this good seed never know war and destruction!

We truly thank the Samaritan Bag for the second time. These funds have greatly helped our church in helping the affected people. They had the opportunity to send brothers from the church, who, in addition to humanitarian aid, have twice traveled to Chernihiv region, where they helped the affected residents during the week: filming roofs and windows, repairing, preparing houses for living. Accordingly, materials were purchased for this purpose. We also settled three refugee families in our community, paid for their utilities and helped with food. We continue to receive refugees on the territory of the church. Then we ship to Poland and Germany. We prepare lunches and breakfasts for the military living in our community. Thank you very much for your help, this is a great support for us. With God, Ukraine will win.

 Thank you very much to the Lord and to you, that it was at this time that He gave us the opportunity to serve food and evacuation of families with children through this difficult time. We serve children in the villages and it was at this time that there was a problem with the logistics of food there. So we bought them where we could in the city and delivered them to the children. They also had the opportunity to take their families to the western part of the country. May the Lord bless you abundantly. Thank you all.

The funds received from the Samaritan's Bag helped Ukrainian families, who were forced to change their place of residence and move to the western regions of the country, including our area, our village, to adapt to a new location. Members of our church grouped and organized the purchase of food and necessities at the expense of the funds received. Formed assistance packages were received by families who are currently going through difficult times. Our church also joined a volunteer and evangelistic trip to the east of the country, in particular to the Kharkiv region, to help people with food and necessities.

Thank God and you for this blessing. At that time we were thinking about where to get money to buy firewood because people from the village give the settlers a house and there was nothing to heat and we bought firewood and food for them. It was also a wonderful testimony and the other day one person repented, thank God.

Thank you for your financial support for the ministry of the church! Your funds help us deliver humanitarian aid to people affected by the war. Volunteers deliver food to villages, cities where people really need it. Delivery of products is expensive because fuel prices have risen. We deliver medicines, vegetables, fruits to the hospital, the hospital. We deliver to the military standing at the forefront: clothing, hygiene products, food, medicine. We are very grateful for your open heart for the people of Ukraine! PS If there is an opportunity to donate money for our service, we would like to provide a foreign currency account because the Bank has an understated exchange rate and we lose a large amount of money.

From the second day of the war until today, we have accepted more than 200 people from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Izium, Kramatorsk and Lysychansk to the church base for long-term residence. Currently, 115 people live on the base. Mostly families. Every Sunday we hold services for them, every Wednesday a small group studying the Bible, also organized a service for children through sports. Funds from the Samaritan's Bag were used for food, utilities, clothing, hygiene products and medicine for displaced people. All the days of the war the church takes care of them.

At this difficult time for Ukraine, any help saves someone's life. We are located in the modest city of Krivoy Rog. We are located 50 kidometers from the military border of contact. And so every day someone tries to leave that dangerous territory for life for themselves and their families. Since the beginning of the war, our church has actively helped immigrants, refugees and residents of our region. Due to the fact that we were not ready for war, we were practically not ready for it. In this regard, any assistance, especially financial, provides many opportunities. For the past 85 days, our church has been buying essentials, humanitarian aid and giving it to those in need. We are also actively engaged in the fact that we take out civilians from points close to the military border on our own. We also give all those in need accommodation, food, find and send to the transport where the person who applied to us would like to go. Thanks to the help of the Samaritan's Bag, as long as we had enough funds, we were able to live such an active life. More than 5000 migrants in different city centers are now receiving help from our church, to whom we go weekly with food, essentials, personal hygiene. Now we are looking for new sponsors, since more than 30 new people contact us daily, and help it gets harder and harder for them. Despite all this, thanks to the funds from the Bag of the Samaritan, we were able to help more s from different regions of Ukraine.  Also, thanks to this financial assistance, we had the opportunity to periodically help the baby home, which brought up more than 60 children aged 2 to 16 years who were brought from the occupied territories. You can see it in the last photo.

At this difficult time for Ukraine, any help saves someone's life. We are located in the modest city of Krivoy Rog. We are located 50 kidometers from the military border of contact. And so every day someone tries to leave that dangerous territory for life for themselves and their families. Since the beginning of the war, our church has actively helped immigrants, refugees and residents of our region. Due to the fact that we were not ready for war, we were practically not ready for it. In this regard, any assistance, especially financial, provides many opportunities. For the past 85 days, our church has been buying essentials, humanitarian aid and giving it to those in need. We are also actively engaged in the fact that we take out civilians from points close to the military border on our own. We also give all those in need accommodation, food, find and send to the transport where the person who applied to us would like to go. Thanks to the help of the Samaritan's Bag, as long as we had enough funds, we were able to live such an active life. More than 5000 migrants in different city centers are now receiving help from our church, to whom we go weekly with food, essentials, personal hygiene. Now we are looking for new sponsors, since more than 30 new people contact us daily, and help it gets harder and harder for them. Despite all this, thanks to the funds from the Bag of the Samaritan, we were able to help more s from different regions of Ukraine.  Also, thanks to this financial assistance, we had the opportunity to periodically help the baby home, which brought up more than 60 children aged 2 to 16 years who were brought from the occupied territories. You can see it in the last photo.

Let's call it "Guided by Believers" The story is as follows. One family (mother and five children) With twins and a neighbor and grandparents, a total of 15 people. They lived in Luhansk region, on the border with Luhansk People's Republic. When the war broke out, they could not withstand the explosions for 15-20 days and were looking for a way to get some rest from the shots and explosions. Their homes were destroyed, and they covered distances from the bomb shelter to the bomb shelter, hoping that volunteers would come to some shelter and take them out, and 15 of them. It happened that two buses, on which Christians were volunteers, got to them - they left. Moving to Poltava region, they spent several days. Already being somewhere in the area, they came across an announcement of evacuation from the church. Read the comments on whether the organization is normal. Deciding to go and get on the buses, 15 people left for Lviv, but the next day after their arrival they were sent to Rivne, where they spent 5 days in one of the houses of prayer in the city. They are not lazy and penetrating people, so they immediately looked for a house, and when they found it, they moved to the Dubno region, being there in the village - they did not have a refrigerator. God always led them through His children, and He did not stop, because their need miraculously came to us, and with God's help we bought them a refrigerator. The refrigerator is a miracle! Price -as a gift. God is good We could also make more than 300 food packages and send them to hot spots in Ukraine. In truth, we cried when we received money, because the Lord gives the desire to do and immediately shows the finances for which to do so. Thank God!

The funds received from the Samaritan Bag were used to improve the living conditions of refugees in the Church of Christ the Savior: purchase of beds and bedding, arrangement of a shower room and kitchen, purchase of special equipment for people with disabilities, etc. Food was also procured to prepare food for refugees living in the church and to form food kits for those living alone. We have formed a warehouse of things: from clothes to hygiene products and medicines, which we distribute to the needy. We take an active part in the lives of refugees, helping with the challenges they face. Our church helps the most vulnerable categories of the population: women and children, large families, orphans, people with disabilities, the elderly, cancer patients and more.

Dear brothers and sisters. I sent you a report and was not attentive and sent you a video and not a photo, so I'm sorry if it doubles. Thanks to your support, we were able to help many people with medicine and food. Those people who no longer had any hope, the Lord came to them and fed them. He did not give the necessary medicine, but the main thing is that even in difficult circumstances, people who were left homeless and with some hope. Thanks to your support, many people have believed in Christ and put all their strength and hope in the Lord. It is simply through ordinary medicine or food that people open their hearts to the help of Christ as Savior. And the Lord is changing people and their lives, thank you for your support, which is very much needed by many people in such a difficult time. May the Lord bless you in all things Amen

This is a family of immigrants from the Donetsk region. We helped them build a house. But one of the family members, Grandpa, needed a pressure medication. He did not find such in local pharmacies. So we found on the Internet, ordered and delivered the right drug. They also told the gospel. Glory to Jesus Christ!

We truly thank Samaritan's Bags for their financial assistance! This enabled many people to serve in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. From the first days of the war, we received internally displaced persons and helped them go abroad. Then there was a great need for food, and we began to buy basic products in wholesale warehouses: oil and cereals. Food kits were packaged and sent to Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Luhansk regions. People were taken out in the opposite direction - from hot spots! We have heard many words of gratitude, and we convey to you from the migrants who were at a large-scale children's holiday, which was attended by more than 600 people. The children happily unpacked the gifts, and thanks to this they were able to hear about the value and relevance of Christ's Resurrection! May the Lord bless you and reward you a hundredfold!

Thanks to the Purse Samaritan mission, we were able to equip 1.5 tons of food cargo to eastern Ukraine. In a few days, this product will be delivered to remote corners of villages that have suffered destructive power and do not have the necessary products. Thank you very much for your cooperation and blessings. We love everyone who helps us. The Lord is with you and will repay everyone for everything.

Thank God, the good Samaritan received money from the bag, and was able to help many people affected by the difficult times of the war with Russia. Helped migrants with housing, food, clothing. Many people have accepted Jesus Christ into their hearts (repented) and served the Lord. People are happy and the church that breaks with the Samaritan Bag can serve the Lord.

Our church provided food to refugees living in dormitories in our community, as well as visiting various needy families. Some people asked for help, others we found and helped. People are in great need of help and thank you so much for it. They also helped in part people who are in a difficult financial situation, have lost their jobs or are insecure. Some of the refugees returned to their homes, but attended our meetings. Thank you very much for the joint work we have already done and which we continue to do. God's blessing!

Some of the settlers realized that the war was dragging on, their homes were either bombed or occupied, so they decided to stay here and plant gardens. Our fellow villagers brought planting potatoes and onions, and people take them and plant them.

<p>
My sincere thanks to the Samaritan's Bag project for the blessed and accessible opportunity it provided in the form of funds for real assistance to the internally displaced and those affected by the war in Ukraine. With these funds, we were able to help 327 families who found themselves in difficult life circumstances in other areas without having acquaintances or relatives, and having difficult financial opportunities. We held various events and gave gifts to the children of these families. We looked for houses for these people, made small repairs and gave them the opportunity to live in a safer area, for which they are very grateful. Vasyl and Kateryna, with their two children and parents, were forced to leave Severodonetsk with great adventures under the shelling. They did not know where to go. In the shelter program, they found a phone number and called us to spend the night. After talking to us and waking up early, they asked if they could stay in this town. We found a house for them, gave them clothes and everything they needed for living, a frying pan, a bowl, bowls, utensils, an electric kettle, an electric stove and other household items. They did not plan to stay for a long time, but the situation in their city has worsened, so they still live with us, but dream of returning to their hometown. Thank you so much for supporting both the products and everyone else for their lives. May the Good Lord abundantly Bless you in your life and ministry!

Glory to our Lord for your ministry and His care for us! This money has been a great blessing to every member of the church and to the many unbelievers we have been able to serve. Each of our church members is clearly convinced that the Lord takes care of us and does not leave and sends everything necessary for life and even more. Thanks to the money we received from you, we were able to purchase a large amount of food, medicine and personal care products and organize a warehouse. As well as pay for the delivery of humanitarian aid from Germany and Poland. We also provide humanitarian assistance to unbelieving people who REALLY needed it and were able to testify to them about Christ. Now 2 unbelieving families began to go to our church whom we were able to help and evangelize them. Other unbelievers also visit and can hear about Christ, people in this difficult time are really open to this. Also, our church every summer helped organize a camp for the disabled, and now we support some of them with food and medicine. I repeat once again - Glory to the Lord for your ministry, you have no idea how grateful we are for your timely support!

We truly thank you for your financial help !!! Thanks to her, we were able to provide humanitarian aid, hygiene and food to the displaced people, which was accepted by our church. We spent part of the money on fuel to deliver basic necessities to cities in eastern Ukraine. We organized transport and took away those in need free of charge. Also, our church helps people rebuild destroyed houses in the Kyiv region, we buy building materials ourselves. The Church of the Transfiguration continues to serve and help others!

Thank you for your financial support and your sacrificial hearts. It is very necessary now. We helped widows whose husbands died in the war. They also helped families who lived in dangerous places. One of these families lived in Gostomel. They have two children 1.5 and 5 years old, boys. Also, the family who lived in Kyiv became IDPs, the wife is pregnant ... They are not working at the moment. They also helped low-income families. Assistance was provided to retirees and those in the disability group. Helped a man who was hospitalized with heart disease. At the moment, they are still deciding whether to perform the operation. This family currently has no income. Received a lot of words of gratitude from the recipients! Thank you again for your financial support. Bless you in your work !!! We pray for you and your ministry!

We use the funds to provide food assistance to people living in our church area. Support is provided as follows: three different groups of people come to us three times a week, from 100 to 150 people at a time. Accordingly, 300 - 450 people per week. Everyone gathers in the hall, listens to a sermon, prays for Ukraine, writes down passport data, distributes food packages, and is invited to Sunday services. We also carry food packages to the countryside to families with many children in need. And we do all this with your help.

Many people lost their jobs due to the war and lost their finances. They are in great need of food and clothing. It is the Church that has become responsible for many people in this need. We periodically hold evangelistic events with the distribution of food kits for people in need and clothing. We do such actions near the prayer house and on the streets in our district of Zaporozhye. We tell people about the love and mercy of Christ to each of them. We also feed people and communicate with them, we invite them to meetings in the Church. People ask to be prayed for. ------------ Photos for some reason do not load ....

<p>
 family came to Pereyaslav because of the war, mother Julia, 41 years old, children - Olya, 15, and Ilya, 13 years old. They lived in the city of Alchevsk, Lug. obl. (territory not controlled by Ukraine). In addition to the military situation, the family was pushed to leave by the suicide of their grandmother, who hanged herself in Ilya's room. At one time, Julia worked and lived with children in the camp "Dzherelo Nadiya". The children settled down to study at school. Olya studies well, and Ilya is prone to theft, skips school, does not spend the night at home, terrorizes his mother and those who rented housing to them. In this regard, they were forced to move out of the apartment they were renting. They were taken in by a sister from the church, but after several conflicts over Elijah, the unbelieving son of the sister kicked them out of the house. Soon, we were forced to urgently decide how to accommodate the family, at least for a short time. They settled in a room in a separate church building. It has not yet been possible to find other housing for them.

Anna Pavlovna, 91 years old, lying down. Lives in with. Tsybli. Five years ago my legs gave out. No kids. The husband died a long time ago. No relatives or friends either. She lies herself, in a house that began to fall. The house has not been renovated for a very long time. A neighbor brings, if possible, food for Anna Pavlovna. The neighbor's son comes to heat the room where Anna Pavlovna lives. She was very happy to see us and get help. I'm glad someone remembers her.

congratulate you!! Our church thanks you very much for your financial help, since the beginning of the war we have remained in place and served the people. Our village is near the town of Okhtyrka (30 km.) Where battles were fought, people fled to us, scared without anything, the only thing they could take was documents. We helped them with food, baby food, diapers, hygiene, clothes. Our church also helped feed our soldiers, we took care of pastries and borscht, every day we each baked something sweet in our homes, and my husband and I then went and collected to give to the boys. The man and the pastor went to distribute food kits to those villages and towns that had already been liberated, what they saw was just awful. Unfortunately, our pastor was involved in an accident while dying for another consignment of humanitarian aid. God has given us the strength not to break down and continue to serve. Another organization received up to 150 soldiers a day, where they could wash, wash / dry clothes, and we were asked to help with washing powder and roast coffee so that the boys could taste while washing their clothes. So the next day we brought coffee with roasts. Too many people need help, many have lost their jobs, and cannot buy basic things, so we invite people to church every Sunday, where they can receive not only physical food but also spiritual food. Thanks to your help, the Lord will be glorified. Thank you to all your team, may the Lord bless your work ¦ ?.

The money received from the Samaritan's Bag helps us to provide for the people left in their cities, in a difficult situation, without work, food, and medicine for everything necessary for life. With this money we buy food and deliver it to people who are unable to evacuate and do not have the means to survive.

 want to share my testimony of how you helped many needy migrants in Ukraine. and we had a desire to help them and whoever could, they provided shelter, others fed but we wanted to help more and here comes the message that the Samaritan Bag provides funds. purchase food and distribute it to the needy in our Church and at the same time proclaim the Gospel and invite people to attend services. There were no funds, so we began to pray that God would help. And then some friends responded, then others..and then borrowed a little..and so we constantly see that there are no funds and there is nothing to give to the needy and then God so bless what is again.Now a week more than 300 families received groceries Other organizations have also blessed us with clothing and baby food and hygiene. This is such a difficult time for our country and many people can hear it. Thank you very much for the idea and the opportunity to serve other people and we hope that the mistake will be corrected and we will be able to serve the needy even more. we help others. May God abundantly bless you and all your families!

Peace to you friends! We truly thank the Samaritan Bag for providing funds to serve the people during the war! This is incredible support. First of all, we had the opportunity to buy fuel for cars to deliver aid to the villages and towns of Sumy and Kharkiv regions, and it also helped us to evacuate people even more to a safer place. They had the opportunity to buy several tons of products (cereals, oil, sugar) and deliver them to Trostyanets, Okhtyrka and villages near these cities. It was with your support that we were able to purchase essential medicines for retirees. Many times, bringing help to the villages, people with tears in their eyes thanked for bringing food and basic necessities. One day, while evacuating a mother with five children, it was difficult to hold back tears when they told how bombs exploded near them and killed their neighbors. They were incredibly grateful that we picked them up and helped them get to Lviv. Thank you very much for your work and support! With gratitude and prayers for you Church New Life Kotelva!

We are very grateful to the partners of the Samaritan Bag Service for the financial help that is very important for our local church. The funds are used for volunteer trips, for fuel to Poland and Ukraine, to deliver humanitarian aid to people affected by the fighting in Chernihiv, Donetsk and Kyiv regions. One of the last trips was to the town of Avdiivka, which is on the front line, where there is constant fighting, people are forced to live in basements, and are very dependent on such assistance. There were also trips to the border with Belarus, where dry rations, essentials and medicines were distributed to our military. Food packages were distributed to low-income, large families in our village and families of migrants. We hope that we will continue to be able to help those in need. May the Lord bless you abundantly.

We truly thank you for the financial assistance we so desperately need during these difficult times of war. We used the funds to meet the needs of needy people: 1. Transport costs for the delivery of humanitarian goods from the Polish border to Irpen, Bucha, Kyiv, Borodyanka, Zagalka, and nearby villages in our area, which are under Russian occupation; 2. Purchased construction materials to cover broken roofs and to smash broken windows and doors in the homes of victims; 3. Fed hot meals to people who had nowhere to go, why, and what to cook for themselves; 4. We deliver assistance to families who are unable to come or go to aid distribution points; A family of ten living in the village of Babyntsi, Kyiv region, survived the occupation by Russian troops. According to grandmother Svetlana, it was very scary when there was a big shooting, which shook the house, frightened children cried. They hid in the cellar, but it was very damp and cold. I had to find a small room where everyone huddled and everyone sat there. A huge column of tankies and Russian armored vehicles stood on their street for a long time. Russian troops entered every house with weapons. The Kadyrovites visited their house three times. The village was under occupation for more than a month. During this time, Grandmother Sveta gave birth to a grandson, Bogdanchik, on March 14. Grandmother Sveta sincerely thanks God for saving their lives. We want to share with you how the Lord works with the hearts of people who have suffered from war and are in dire need of protection and help. Natalia Borysivna, a mathematics teacher, lives in Irpin, not far from our church, but has never attended church and was an atheist. During the war, a shell hit her house and opened the roof. She was terribly worried about what would help her. The youth of our church and their friends repaired the roof and covered it from the rain. On Sunday, May 22, she came to church and repented, accepting the Lord as her personal Savior.

Thanks to your support, we were able to purchase 5 tons of products, which were transported to Sumy, to the liberated towns and villages. Hundreds of people gathered there to whom we shared the gospel and provided food aid. In total, we helped about 3,000 people. These are Trostyanets, Okhtyrka and several villages of Trostyanets district. We saw people's tears because it was a time when the state had not yet provided aid, only churches and volunteers. We were able to sow the Word of God in people's hearts, to testify in action of His love. Today, several dozen new people have started attending the local church. We heard testimonies from people who were under occupation and in dire need of food. Our arrival was often a response to their needs. May God bless your work and reward you for your sacrifice so that you and your children will never be in need and will not experience the horrors of war.

We are very grateful to the sponsors and organizers of the Samaritan's Bag project for their financial assistance. After all, in such an important and difficult period for our country, your help has given hope to many disadvantaged people. Thanks to your help, we were able to provide it for refugees who have lost their homes. They were able to find rest in our local church, and were provided with the most necessary things and delicious food. We also had the opportunity to provide first aid to everyone. And a lot of money was spent on the purchase of the most necessary things (mats, sleeping bags, flashlights, clothes, food, medicine) for the military, who are at the forefront. Our brothers and sisters had the opportunity to personally deliver food and clothing to the people in the occupied territories.

Thank you very much for the partnership and the funds provided for social services during the war! We used the funds you provided us to prepare hot lunches at checkpoints for defenders and a volunteer center that weaves protective nets on the front line. Previously, 200 servings were prepared daily, now 100 servings every day. Our church also provides food kits to IDPs, poor people referred to us by the city's social services, and large families, with 200 large food packages and 1,000 small food packages each week. We transfer medicines and personal hygiene products to the regional hospital. Thank God for working together! May the Lord bless you generously!

The village of Tamarine and the surrounding villages have been under occupation since February 28, 2022. Since March 18 there are fences (Kadyrov, Buryats). People's homes were looted, household appliances were looted, and many victims of violence. No one is allowed in the direction of Snihurivka, they fire at once. People who can, get to Kherson for bread, on a dirt road. Elderly people who received a pension by mail no longer receive it. So he has no money for bread or medicine. Your help to the villagers is to evacuate those who managed to escape (mothers take their daughters shaved bald, disguised as a boy, in dirty clothes), as well as to purchase medicine, send food to those residents of the village of Tamarine who were able to escape the occupation. We are constantly in touch with the remaining villagers, trying to provide them with the necessary medicines. Evidence: Russian troops (Kadyrovites) categorically banned entry into Ukrainian-controlled territory for fear of execution. On the 40th day of the war, our sister from the church with. Tamarino, received a certificate in the spirit that you need to go. While they were assembling, 34 cars lined up behind their car. The Kadyrovites blocked their way. The sister went to talk to them. The Holy Spirit gave something to say. Those who blocked the road turned out to be orthodox Muslims who fasted and prayed every day that day. The Kadyrovites parted, opened the way for them and all 34 cars of 7-8 people each, safely left for the territory controlled by Ukraine.

Brother Slavik from the city of Khmelnitsky delivers humanitarian aid to cities from the war zone (Severodonetsk, Liman, Seversk, Kramatorsk). He takes the refugees back. Twice Slavik barely escaped artillery and rocket fire. His own VolksWagen T4 minibus was subjected to a lot of wear and tear due to constant overloads and long distances. Once he, loaded with humanitarian aid, broke down right on the highway. Slavik found himself in a difficult financial situation. We compensated him for a significant portion of the cost of the engine overhaul, and together we thanked God that we had Samaritan's Bag funds so timely.

Our church sincerely thanks you for the opportunity to serve people in such a difficult time! We are in the west of our country, where there are currently a lot of displaced people. Many fled their homes without the necessary things, with small children, with old parents, with the sick who needed difficult medicines, etc., hygiene, clothing and other necessary things, food. Our church has visited them all many times, providing them with everything they need and telling them about God, who does not leave us all and worries even in very difficult times. We cried with them and prayed, they sincerely thanked God for their help, because we did not expect such care. Some people fled in large groups, we settled them in schools, where they still live, we helped to arrange their living conditions. Also, our church united with another, made a lot of stews, food kits and more than one car went to the cities where heavy fighting is taking place - Kharkiv, Irpin. People in those areas and cities can survive thanks to such trips and thanks to the help you provide. God works through you, and changes our attitude to service, but most importantly, in such a difficult time, you can see how people repent and seek salvation from God! Thank you for your support in a difficult time! May God bless us!

Late in the evening, on May 24, grandfather, Boris Andreevich, aged 94, was brought to the Church of the Ark of Salvation. His house in the village of Ozerny was completely destroyed. Grandfather smelled of artillery smoke and brick dust. He is smart and quite independent. "When he learned that he was being assigned to a nursing home, he begged to be left free to move. Brother Igor responded to accompany him to the Kharkov rehabilitation center. Thanks to the Samaritan's Bag for financial participation in this good cause! God knows your names.

One day our church is very grateful to you for the help you have given to the church. And thanks to this we were able to help many people who were in dire need of food and even fuel to transport medicines. People who have lost all hope and hope for something today believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and put all their hopes in him in this difficult time. Thank you very much for your support.

During the war we were able to distribute more than 2,000 food kits in various regions of Ukraine. More than 150 people were helped to travel to safe areas and abroad. We now have a "Help is" project in the church, which gives us the opportunity to help hundreds of people every week. Thanks to Samaritan's Bag for the money and the opportunity to help many people.

Currently, these funds have been used to purchase tanks and fuel. Because there is no fuel. Sometimes there is gas, but the queue for it is 2-3 km. Now we can serve the needy, go for help, then deliver it to the needy. For now, that's a huge answer for us. Because fuel was ordered from Western Ukraine and they were able to bring it to us. With prayer for peace and everyone who serves.

Dear partners! In the days when our country is going through extremely difficult times, we, for our part, try to take maximum care of people who are in despair and constant fear. Our church has taken on the mission of visiting those who are left alone with their grief. Every day we visited several families raising children with disabilities, trying to calm them down and provide spiritual support. For the most needy, we provided assistance in the form of diapers, nappies, medicines. The strong half of our church has maximally joined in another direction. Thus, from the first days of the war, drivers made evacuation trips from the most affected cities of Ukraine, and transported humanitarian goods to the victims. Service volunteers joined to raise money for our army. A camp for temporarily displaced persons has been set up on the basis of a boarding house belonging to our church. During the twenty days of the war, we were able to help more than 500 people from different regions of Ukraine. I am attaching to this story the testimony of the Trusov family, who lived at the address of the Kyiv region, Makariv village, who, together with other refugees, are under the care of our church. It all started on the 25th. We woke up from the explosions, the children were screaming and crying in fear. For 12 days we lay under fire. They hid as best they could. I ordered the children not to leave the house. Every time I went to the yard, I was horrified to see people and animals killed. It was very dangerous, because bombs and shrapnel destroyed our homes. Life became unbearable when the Russians began to extinguish the houses without disassembling. The military broke into our homes, confiscated phones and equipment, and threatened them with machine guns. On March 9, we managed to get out of this horror. My closest neighbor and I got on a bus that helped us save our children. The road to western Ukraine was not easy. We often stopped at checkpoints, and the exhausted children slept, because we escaped from hell. A few days later we received very painful news: we have nowhere to return - our houses were destroyed. We have six children, my friend is a widow, and I am expecting a child. I do not want to leave my native Ukraine, but I have to take care of the little ones. We plan to cross the border. In a month, God willing, I will have another daughter. Honestly, I didn't expect God to lead me through the people I met at the boarding house. We were dressed, fed and provided with a good room with amenities. I want to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who helps us in these difficult times.

Blessed is the Samaritan Bags team. We are grateful for your support and funds. Our church is located in Kropyvnytskyi on the way to Western Ukraine. Many refugees where hostilities are taking place (Zaporizhia, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv) pass by or stay here near our church. They do not have basic necessities, so we plan to provide them. There are not enough medicines in pharmacies, they went to Romania to buy what they needed. Funds are also needed for fuel. Thank you. May the Lord bless you

 few days ago, our Church "The Radiance of God's Glory" received material assistance from the "Samaritan's Bag", which is already being received by refugees, simply people without a livelihood, due to the lack of the opportunity to earn these funds, large families and churches in the hot spots of Ukraine where now a humanitarian catastrophe. In particular, the city of Kharkiv, where our church members take food and much more in their personal vehicles. This help also goes to prison churches in many places in Ukraine. We are very grateful to you, without you it would not have been possible, for everything GLORY TO OUR GOD dear friends, with love for you, the pastor of the Church Dmitry Ryabov.

Dear employees! Peace to you and your families! We are grateful to God for always, under all circumstances, giving an understanding of His will, helping to understand how to act and what to do. Undoubtedly, it is important to hear His voice and follow it. Our work is focused on the Pyriatyn region, located in the Poltava region. With the start of the war, new, still unfamiliar, worries came into our missionary workdays. Our region is one of the few in Eastern Ukraine that God preserves in peace and relative silence. We are grateful to God for that. At the same time, our region has become one of those where people rush to war. I'm sure you know the horror of this situation. That is why it is important for us today to help sheltered families as much as possible: housing, food, medicine, clothes and more. To date, about 50 migrant families have moved to the city. We, as a church, have gained considerable trust from the city leaders in our previous years of ministry. Therefore, the city first turns to us for help where they do not have the opportunity to do so. So, what can we do for the settlers here now and what are we already doing: - 3 times a week we buy bread (from 200 loaves at a time) and distribute it in the church. Some of those who receive this bread tell us that this bread is dried and eaten throughout the week; - Almost every day we receive addresses from the city with the families of migrants and requests for help: medicines, cereals, food, baby formula, diapers and other minimum necessary for life and accommodation. We pack packages and deliver them around the city. At the same time, we are building friendly relations with these people, learning about their additional needs, and inviting them to join in common prayers for Ukraine in the church. People are now very willing to respond to such invitations; - To have the necessary resources for the formation of food packages, we are looking for volunteers who can bring everything you need from Western Ukraine here. This includes significant sums for the purchase of gasoline and transport services; - purchase of clothes, towels, bedding, outerwear, shoes for migrants; - assistance in further transportation of migrants to Western Ukraine. So far, about 20 people have been deported from the city; - serving in the green corridors - preparing hot meals for refugees for a snack during this trip. Dumplings, sandwiches, mashed potatoes, cutlets, hot weather, coffee - all this is taken to the track or to nothing train in Hrebinka. People are very confused and scared. In response to the help they received, they cried, saying: "We are no longer needed. We have nothing left. We didn't think anyone cared about us. We thank you…". Most of them started attending services and prayed with us for peace in Ukraine. We are grateful to God that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, He has given us opportunities and resources to serve where there was nothing but our desire to help. Thank God. We thank God for your love for Ukrainians, for your prayers and indifference to everything that is happening. Be blessed! The missionaries of Pyriatyn and Hrebinka regions are grateful

Many thanks to the Samaritan Bag Project for financial support for our church. Thanks to your sincere help, our church was able to serve the most vulnerable sections of the population of our village. Food was also distributed to people who did not practice the Christian life, but because of this help, people saw in this gesture that the Lord had not forsaken them and that God loved them. And thus they testified to themselves that they began to sincerely believe in God and His care. Also, our village, as well as the city of Kherson, found itself under occupation and food blockade. There is a big problem in buying food and medicine, so we have not spent all the money yet, but we are looking for different ways to buy food and serve our neighbors.

Congratulations to you, brothers and sisters, all partners of the Christmas Child project in the joint work of charity in this difficult time of war. Through your resource, our church in the village. Belokrinichchi was able to reach many families who need help as never before - thank God for that! Together with various help, we try to convey the Word of God, which is able to save and heal people's souls! Our Church is not large, it has 23 members, most of them older people, but young people are actively organized to help people in need during this war period. Thanks to your blessing, we were able to buy a few products from which we make food kits and bless the families in which the men went to war and the children and wife remained at home. They made sandwiches, chebureks and poppy pies, packed them in portions, offered the Our Father prayer and took them to the train station and gave them to migrants fleeing combat zones and were very hungry. and missiles that exploded and caused great damage and ruin in the cities. Photo ¹1 Muzheiko Anatoliy. This man is very God-fearing, kind and polite. Anatoly has suffered a micro-stroke several times already, but God prolongs his life and wants him not to die, but to be saved. In the first days of the war, his son Alexander, took people in his car from the war zone - Irpin, saved lives. Saving the lives of many people, Alexander lost contact and still no one knows where he is and whether he survived. The family is very anxious, but they hope in God and believe that only He can help them find their son. Therefore, pray for this family so that they do not despair of the Lord, but instead entrust their hearts to Jesus as their personal Savior. Photo ¹2 Dmitriev family Oksana and Sasha. This family moved to Bilokrynychchi in 2014, fleeing the war from Luhansk region. God gave them 4 children who cheered their broken hearts. They bought an old house and tried to live forgetting the shooting of Luhansk region. The happy life did not last long, on February 24 the war began in Ukraine, but on a much stronger scale. The Dmitriev family has great experiences, they have repeatedly planned to leave their "nest", but at the moment they are still living in their hut and hope that everything will calm down and peace will come. They were very impressed and grateful for the food set and understand that the Lord cares for them even in such a difficult time of war, especially since Alexander lost the job he had in peacetime! Thank you for being able to serve people with you, to help them with all kinds of help, and at the same time to guide them to Jesus Christ. Bless you from the Lord in your future work.

www.church.dp.ua is the site of our church, where you can see more information about the work of the church during the war. We truly thank the Lord for answering our prayers through you. Due to the fact that a lot of people used the shower, the boller broke, it was necessary to buy a new one, so it was done. You also need to refuel cars and buses to transport people, which is also a big help. And still for food of people, providing them with necessary, means were necessary. We truly thank you for your much-needed help.

From the very beginning of the war, on February 24, our NEW LIFE Church and my family began to host people whom everyone later began to call "IDPs." For the first two weeks of each day we received 5 to 15 people at home, there were a lot of small children. Mostly, they were our friends and acquaintances from other cities: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, Mariupol. Then their friends and acquaintances came to us, with whom we were not acquainted, but the Lord introduced us in this way. In total, more than 80 people passed through our church during these four weeks of these sad events. We stopped not only in our house, but also in the houses of our church members. Even some of my neighbors - my unbelieving neighbor Oleg, a 50-year-old man - are opening their homes to such people. In addition to transit travelers, we also try to help those people who came to our neighborhood Kropyvnytskyi and settled here for a while, from other major cities of Ukraine - who are fleeing the war, but still can not go further. Yes, the other day we met a young woman - Valentina. Valentina (mother, 30 years old) and her two children - daughter Veronica (10 years old) and son Vladislav (7 months old) were forced to leave their hometown due to heavy shelling. Valentina's family from Chernihiv and this city is now in a very difficult situation: constant rocket fire on buildings. The young woman says that the school and kindergarten in their area have already been destroyed, as well as some houses, no water and heating, and almost no grocery stores. Valentina left with the children, and her husband stayed at home to look after their apartment. At the moment, it is very difficult to leave such cities, because there is shelling all the time and there are no green corridors. We have to go on field roads. With God's help, they got to Kropyvnytskyi and settled here with Olga's wives (according to the state program to support IDPs). Our church, maintaining good relations with the municipal authorities, learned about this family and visited them the other day. We gave them food, children's toys, stationery, hygiene items, Christian literature. Marina talked a little with Valentina and her daughter. We ask you to pray for such families, of which there are hundreds of thousands in Ukraine today. With all our hearts we, the Evangelical Church "NEW LIFE" New city Kropyvnytskyi, Kirovohrad region, we express our sincere gratitude to all those who supported us prayerfully and financially in this difficult time for all of Ukraine. We pray to the Lord God to bless everyone with His Peace and Grace! We pray that through this care and help of our people, the Merciful God Jesus Christ will be revealed to people, that they may seek Him and find Him as their Personal Savior and Lord! Glory and Gratitude to him for everything! Sincerely, Serhiy Teslenko, Pastor of the New Life Church 23.03.2022ð.

We organized the production of bulletproof vests, make plates from the springs, shoot, vulcanize, sew plate socks and take them to the front. Too many guys have no protection. At the request of soldiers, we buy equipment, bring food and chance tools. They helped a family from Mariupol and a totally blind girl who suffered a severe stest injury.

22.03.2022 Ukraine Kropyvnytskyi city Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists "Christ the Savior" "do not weaken in diligence; fervent in spirit; serve the Lord;" (Rom.12:11) In this period of war, we want to tell you first of all, we have not weakened, we are burning in spirit, we are serving the Lord. Today we testify that the love of the Lord Jesus Christ shines in a special way through evangelical churches around the world. Today, the children of God all over the world do not stand aside and do not leave the Ukrainian churches alone with the problem. From the very first day, our church received immigrants, providing them with good food, good lodging, and warm walls of the house of prayer. No one thought about the costs, we did not expect help, we were burning for the service of God through the acceptance of immigrants, all the glory belongs to the Lord, because we all showed the Name and love of Christ. We assure you that the financial assistance that God has sent through you today greatly supports our ministry. We thank all your National Leadership Team for the project "Children's Child" of Ukraine. And also Franklin Graham, for the fact that you were able to share with us participation in this common ministry, we thank the Lord and you that the Christian family today, more than ever, is driven by love, mercy, compassion and is not limited to church walls, but shows to the whole world We are one in Christ. Thank you for supporting our common ministry. With love and respect, Christ the Savior ECB Church. Pastor - Georgy Nikolaevich Doroshenko Ukraine Kropyvnytskyi city Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists "Christ the Savior" We thank the Lord that He leads His work through our church. And also we thank your team for the located heart to our common service. During the 28 days of the war, our church was able to help almost two thousand migrants, about seventy percent of them were children. The church provided good nutrition, a good warm overnight stay within the church walls. Thanks to your support, we will be able to continue serving further, at the highest level. The finances were directed to: - the purchase of food - the purchase of food supplies - disposable tableware - all utility costs (gas, electricity, water, pumping out the drain pit) - the purchase of bottled gas for cooking for displaced persons) - the removal of women and children to a safe place. - purchase of medicines - purchase of fuel for generators. - Bought a small wood stove. Our church team continues to perform this ministry with zeal and fervor, giving all the glory to the Lord. We testify that unbelieving people, having visited our church, hearing that it was God who organized everything for them free of charge, leave with tears and delight in misunderstanding that our Faith was closed to them, but today they saw in the children of God unity, disinterested care, inexplicable love. Our heart rejoices in glorifying the Lord through this opportunity to serve the people. We also testify that the believers who visited our church admire the work of the Lord, and in these circumstances, seeing how the churches rallied, they say: we see that God has not abandoned us, He still takes care of us. Passing these trials today, we ask God for mercy on our people and thank all those who are not indifferent today in unity cry for us to God.

Peace be upon you, dear brothers and sisters. We thank God for peace and the opportunity to serve others. Yesterday (March 23, 22) I was Tarabara Svitlana, I had the opportunity (together with Yulia Shevkova) to visit refugees who currently live in the villages of Koby, Stovbyna Dolyna, Grekopavlivka. In total, there were 5 families with a total of ~ 20 people. Our goal was to get to know each other personally and to encourage people to get to know God. In my opinion, it worked. Apart from the 20 people we told about God's mercy and protection, only one family did not accept us. We gave the children Samaritan packages and children's Bibles, an interesting fact - parents ask for Bibles in Ukrainian. Each child was told that Jesus loved him and wanted to give him eternal life. They reminded that only God's hand can close the sky and stop the enemy, that the prayer of a child has great power, and the prayer of the parents is always heard by the Lord. They also learned about their needs, all these people came with the same clothes, they don't even have change of clothes and shoes. We thank Christians in the United States from the Samaritan Bag Mission for financial support. Thanks to it we can buy basic necessities. Today (24.03.22) I bought bedding, towels, clothes, underwear, home shoes and food worth UAH 4,000. This assistance will be delivered to the family of Oli Lyuklyan with 7 people who left the city of Okhtyrka. (mother, three daughters, granddaughter, grandson and son-in-law) currently live in the village. Koby Poltava region. Friends, we do not know when these trials will come to an end, but we can make it morally easier for people, because they know better than anyone else the price of a clean bed and washed socks. Together they lived for a week in the cellar, sleeping on potatoes and foam, and when they were taken out they prayed to heaven to stay alive! My sincere thanks to all who are involved in this cause, for prayers and finances, for blessings and psychological support. I want to wish you God's peace, be the light that shines in the dark and does not burn the forest. Help God to remain heavenly!

When the war started, it caught us by surprise, people stopped going to work, everything stopped. We have the Zorya mission, but at that time we had nothing, no products, no money on the balance, and we announced a fundraiser in our church, a few people donated money, we bought food for them, but it was absolutely a little. And here refugees from hot spots began to come and go to us. At this time, your financial aid came to us on a mission, it was a great blessing, we could not give birth, it caused tears of joy and gratitude for such wonderful friends of our Samaritan Bag, it really fits the name "Samaritan Bag". We were able to buy flour, rice, buckwheat, semolina, bulgur, oil, butter, tea, salt, baby food, hygiene products ... and many other things necessary for the life of refugees. All our team sincerely thanks you, may God bless you abundantly, and give you a hundred times more, may your families, your homes, your children be blessed !!! We love you and pray for you.

Thank God. We truly thank you for the financial help of our church, which helped to feed and provide accommodation in our church for migrants from the East, part of the funds went to food, part of the funds to refuel the bus and take women with children to the border with Poland. the door of the bus opened at the border, we said "When it's all over, go back", to which they replied "We no longer have a place to go back" and at that moment just tears in the eyes of both women and in the eyes of our fellow servants, for every one of us has a compassionate heart, I believe that Jesus makes our hearts like that after sincere repentance. The second area where our church was able to focus is the feeding of our compatriots traveling from the East by rail. they said "God loves you" and I thank you for seeing how difficult it was for people to miss words and keep going, but stopped and smiled, which means that some people have these words in their hearts and I believe that this will be the seed that will be to grow. There were also people who did not want to eat, but took the New Testaments, and because it is a conscious decision, I believe that these people will sincerely read the Word of God. For us Christians, this is the time when we can serve and show what is in our hearts, set an example of a Christian. https://youtu.be/DJBOd7lDUBI https://fb.watch/bZAB1sAjjw/

Dear friends, our church is very grateful to you for your financial assistance. We use these funds as efficiently as possible. Already today in the Territories of the premises belonging to our Church "Ark" we have created places for displaced persons and refugees from the occupied Territories of our country. Church members actively joined and organized meals for all people who come to us. Our church members also actively help with their vehicles to pick up people from places where hostilities are taking place and bring them to our safe place. Today our church has become a great hostel full of love and care. More than 400 people have already benefited from our help. And today we see that the flow of people does not end. Here again I was informed about the arrival of 20 more people. In one of the rooms of our foundation where the orphans whose children we transported temporarily lived in Poland, the workers organized meals for the soldiers defending our city and gave parents and young children the opportunity to live in the rooms of children who lived there before the war. Today, we need passenger buses and minivans to pick up and transport refugees to safe places. We pray and believe that the Lord will help us in this as well. Thank you sincerely for being with us in a very difficult time for our country !!!

Dear Samaritan Bag Mission! The Road to Salvation Church in Shepetivka expresses its gratitude to you for your financial assistance in serving the people who suffered greatly from the war. Using the funds you send, we serve at the train station twice a week to people who are forced to move from cities where hostilities are taking place to safer places. We feed them, put them in rest rooms, testify of Jesus. An average of 200-300 people pass through us in one night. Among them are children. Many of them open their hearts to the Gospel, talk about the horrors they had to go through. In addition to the train station, we serve refugees and our own homes, providing them with a place to spend the night, as well as distributing hot food to people who find themselves in difficult life circumstances of our city.

Peace be upon you! We truly thank God for the opportunity to continue working here in Poltava region. We continue our work here with migrants. This week we tried to help everyone in need with clothes. Together, we collected and brought clothes from Lviv for all migrants to Pyriatyn. For 3 days in a row, people could come and choose for themselves everything they needed. During this time, more than 70 people came to visit us - from Bucha, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kyiv ... The doctors of Chernihiv, who came in their own robes and jackets, were very impressed. People are especially grateful for such help. For those who did not find the right things among the clothes, we bought them separately in our stores. So, the family, temporarily living in the village of Prikhodky, received new shoes 5 pairs. We truly thank you for your support and opportunity to serve all of these people. May God bless you !!!

The Church of Christians of the Faith of the Evangelical City of Shumsk, Ternopil Region, sincerely thanks you for the material assistance we received during this difficult time for the Ukrainian people. By the grace of God, there is no fighting in our territory, so we are making efforts to help the people, God's people, where the rockets hit, shells exploded and bombs fell. Our church has repeatedly sent aid to such regions of the country, including food, hygiene and other necessities. Our brothers, risking their own safety, set off with the necessary cargo, because not all of them left the war zone, church ministers remain on the ground, and people come to church not only to find spiritual support, but also to receive such simple things as bread, medicine and other vital things. During the whole period of the full-scale war, our church sheltered 200 people, some of whom were able to be placed in private homes of brothers and sisters of our community, some of whom wished to go abroad. Currently, the church is home to 70 people who have been temporarily relocated from the war zone, which is fully provided with food, hygiene, clothing and, if necessary, medicines, and food is prepared for such people every day. Temporarily displaced people attend services, come to joint prayers for peace in Ukraine. Conversations and conversations are held with them, and many of them have nowhere to return to after the war, as their homes have been destroyed by the occupiers. There are also meetings for children, where they have the opportunity to read the Bible, play, draw and at the same time feel safe. We, as the Church of Christ, do our best to serve and support these people, to proclaim the Word of God, and we believe that the Word of God has the capacity to grow under the action of the Holy Spirit! We pray for this and bless all who come to us for help! Once again, thank you so much for your financial help, may the Lord bless and give back to everyone for every dollar donated! God's peace and harmony!

Thanks God! I want to testify how God is doing His Miracle in our city, thanks to your financial support. When they called me and said that you want to support our ministry, at that time I had no idea how to do it! The city of Balakleya, Kharkov region, has been under the occupation of Russia and in the ring all this time. Since we have a large military ammunition base and a military repair plant in our city, a lot of Russian equipment drove there and captured the city. People are afraid to leave their homes and basements, explosions are constantly going on, rockets are flying, shootings ... The city is cut off from the region, all bridges are broken, it is impossible to enter or leave the city. People sit in basements and shelters for several days, there is no light, no water, no mobile communications, no heating. There are no groceries in stores and no medicines in pharmacies. No one can bring humanitarian aid to the city, and medicines, too, because. there is a lot of Russian equipment in the city, Russian checkpoints, where cars are taken away and not allowed into the city. The situation in the city is very serious and it seemed we were powerless to do anything at all… but our heart aches for these people and we really wanted to help them… And God is very merciful to us!!! He revealed a MIRACLE and His Glory!!! Just supernaturally began to answer our prayers! As soon as we received your resources, God gave peace in our hearts and we realized that this is God's Answer to our prayers! We felt that if God gave resources, He would arrange everything. They began to pray intensely that God would send volunteers so that we could evacuate people from the city. We do not have such an opportunity, there was no transport to go by ourselves. And thank the Lord, we miraculously found a person who was ready to serve as a transport and take people out. During this time, people are evacuated, 16-17 people are placed in a 9-seater minibus! Isn't it a miracle? People are crying, they do not believe that this happened to them and they were able to leave! It's just a miracle from God! What is impossible for man is possible for God! We have been serving in the city for a week now! It became possible to evacuate people, people walk around the city with bags, walking 10 km to get to the place where the driver can pick them up .. people are in fear, in worry, explosions are constantly heard, but they are ready to go in order to save their life... People are running out of food, sitting half-starved .. But God Supernaturally took care of that too... Thanks to your support, we were able to bring food and medicine to the city. To get them, people go along paths, roundabout ways, on foot through the whole city, how scary they were .. shells are exploding somewhere, planes are flying ... but this does not stop them from going to get food. There is absolutely no way in the city to distribute these products to homes and shelters .. but there is a person from our Team who takes these products, medicines, diapers, baby food, puts it all on his bike and delivers it himself from the outskirts of the city in a roundabout way, to the city in , a safe place where people can come on foot and get . Since there is no electricity in the city and villages, whoever has generators, we help with fuel, because it is impossible to buy it anywhere in the city, there is also no way to withdraw money from the card, the ATMs are empty, they do not replenish, the banks do not work, and there is no cash left at all. There is absolutely no way to take a lot of pictures of the ministry to these people in the city, people's phones are empty, there is no light to charge and there is no Internet. People are afraid to take some pictures, because. the Russian military take away, check and smash phones from people, so people hide phones, they don’t go anywhere with them, turn them off and can only turn them on if they find a place where they catch the network, this is basically somewhere on the outskirts of the city on a hill. People are very grateful, with tears in their eyes and praise God for help from Him! Thus, we can serve not only Christians, but also unbelieving people, neighbors to speak the Good News about Salvation !!! Praise the Lord for His Miracle in this city! And many thanks to your team for their sacrifice and financial assistance! May the Lord reward and bless you! We continue to work, support these people, may God lead the way!! Pray for our city and work, may the Lord open the doors, may humanitarian corridors appear and God's protection be on all of us!!! Glory to Him!!!

The Church of Christ the Savior thanks you for your financial support! At the moment we accept refugees in our own houses and apartments, and we were also given the opportunity to use two halls where people practiced yoga before the war. Mattresses are laid in these halls, and refugees are accepted. Meals were organized in the church premises for people who left the places where the war is being fought.

Peace to you. I am Marina Danilchenko, Vinnytsia, Staromiska Church. We are in Vinnitsa with the whole family, with all six children (the youngest is 3 years old). On the first day of the war, we had thoughts of leaving, but then we prayed and made a decision. We will be together with everyone, because not every family can leave Ukraine. Someone has no money, someone is liable for military service, someone has a child with disabilities, and we decided to stay. But to stay not for fear and fear, but in order to do what God expects from us! You know, we were all waiting for the "summer of the Lord", but we pictured it differently. And now, right now, this time has come for the Church in Ukraine! I value my church, I am proud of our team, people who quickly united and began to serve the refugees. We (starting from February 26) accept people who flee from their cities, we receive more than 300 people every day, in the building of our church, we receive those with small babies at home, we pray with them, we eat, we run to the basement when the sirens they shout, we take them to the hospital if necessary, we look for diapers, insulin, gasoline, spare parts for the car ... .. and in a day or two these people learn about God and about Christians more than hundreds of evangelizations. They become family during this time, they learn the prayer, although no one teaches them. They make a promise never to have abortions, but to give birth to children after living a day in a large family. They call and write until they reach their destination. They send photos, report their joys, that they gave birth to a baby and named it after the son or daughter of the family where they lived ... They write that we will definitely meet after the war and eat not in the basement, but in a restaurant in Poland, Israel, USA…. What stories we have not seen and heard during this month of our ministry. I can't describe everything... And now our activities have expanded: in the dining room of our church, we cook and vacuum ready-made meals up to 2000 servings per night. We make stew from purchased meat. We form boxes with the first necessary products and hygiene products. We buy medicines for people. And in the morning we load cars and deliver it all to the oculated areas of the country, where people do not have the opportunity to cook food, buy food and medicine. We are very grateful to God for this time! I know that there are no guarantees that we will wake up tomorrow on earth, so we are now living life in a very concentrated way, we have mixed goodness, love, faith and hope in large doses!

I, Marina Danilchenko. Our Old Town Church, Vinnytsia, has received significant financial support from the Samaritan Bag. This is very important in this difficult time, it is very valuable for us to feel support and prayer and financial, it helps us to do good in the name of the Lord to those people who need it. I have already written a preliminary certificate (in Russian) about our ministry to the church, but I want to thank you again for these funds. We bought a lot of rice, buckwheat, oil, dry instant soups, meat, detergents, hygiene products, medicines. We need all this every day to prepare food for refugees, whom we accept and provide temporary housing, as well as for delivery in areas where active hostilities are taking place. We deliver to Kharkiv, Kyiv, Nikolaev, Kherson, Poltava, Chernihiv. We truly thank everyone who is financially involved in this assistance. Together we can do a lot of good, mercy, show true love!

During this time, thanks to your funds, we have made 30 bulletproof vests and more than 50 unloadings. We try to deliver all this to the guys who are defending Ukraine on the front line. There is cooperation with the military. At the same time, we deliver household orders for the military and military defense. Our bulletproof vests are tested before shipment and are much cheaper than the ones sold, they cost us from 5200 to 6000 UAH / piece. We spend from 500 to 750 UAH / piece on unloading. Thanks to your money, we have started to work more efficiently.

good hour Thank you for the opportunity to serve the people of the displaced and all those affected by the war in Ukraine. Thanks to your financial support, we can provide temporary free accommodation and refreshments for the needy. Almost every day we provide shelter for 4 to 40 people (adults, children and their pets). We also organize assistance with food kits and hygiene products, medicines for those who stayed in Kropyvnytskyi.

We truly thank God for you and your money, thanks to which every day our local church prepares food for refugees, for those who are still in hot spots and basements. there was no food or water. Every day 20-30 of our sisters and brothers have the opportunity to prepare food for those who suffer from the war, they have this opportunity thanks to your funds. We were also able to receive refugees and provide them with housing, food and necessities ... May the Lord bless you and the whole team that helped with the funds received (thank you very much for your help in filling out applications, for answers even in the middle of the night, you are incredible) and with a hundred prayers for you .. With fervent prayers for you, the church of HVE in the village of Mohylyany ..

We are the Vifezda Mission Charitable Organization. The main direction of our activities before the war was working with children with disabilities and disadvantaged families. But the war crossed everything out and at the moment we are helping refugees from different cities (Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sloviansk ...). Our team is working to ensure that people who come to us can calm down as soon as possible from their worries. We provide them with psychological, humanitarian and material assistance. In total, more than two hundred people with children visited us during the war. Special work is given to work with children, because they have the most emotional anxiety. We have fun with them, walks in the fresh air, English lessons and needlework, but most importantly, we try to bring them the message of Jesus through Bible lessons. Your help is an important contribution to charity in order to help people in need at this difficult time, food, housing, clothing. This contribution helped us to purchase the necessary things and materials.

Congratulations on the love of the Lord Jesus Christ. EHB Church of the Renaissance in Hlynsk is very grateful to you for your financial assistance. Photo 1- We bought food for refugees living in our village - about 200 people Photo 2, photo 3 - We bought food and formed food packages for low-income families of our community who lost their jobs as a result of the war. Photo 4, photo 5 - as a result of natural disasters in our village, on Semigrana Street, which is located on a hill, the water in the wells disappeared, they became silted up and people were left without water. Children are forced to go for water to neighbors who have been able to drill wells (it costs a lot of money). So we decided to provide financial assistance to two families to drill wells.

As a result of full-scale hostilities in Ukraine, we have a large influx of IDPs from cities that have come under fire and bombing, which remain in Slovyansk, Donetsk region, or are heading to the Western regions. Every day we receive up to 60 people from the cities of Severodonetsk, Popasna, Rubizhne, Izyum and other cities in our region. All our actions are aimed at alleviating human suffering and helping people left without housing and basic necessities. Thanks to your support, we provide shelter, hot food, personal hygiene products, medicines, etc.… We also provide, if possible, food for the population of the city of Slavyansk, who as a result of hostilities, found themselves in difficult life circumstances. We truly thank you and bless you.

Sincere gratitude for your help to our Church. Thanks to you we are able to serve every day. Each story is difficult in its own way, but in each one the Lord is glorified. I will probably write this: and their mother were under siege for 19 days in the city of Mareupoli. The Russians destroyed their house. Miraculously escaped from there, they drove towards the border. We had the only car (1993). And we decided to give them our car even though they were left without transport. The Lord put it in my heart. We also gave them food and money on the way to the border. We also take care of people from Kharkiv and other severely affected cities of our Ukraine. Thank you for your support, we do everything to be useful to others ¦ ???????

At such a difficult time for our country, our citizens have come together and help those who need it, many countries support us and your organization is no exception. Part of the funds was spent on food products, in the amount of 100 pcs. Local volunteers asked to help with the purchase of cereals, because they are not brought from abroad. I don't know exactly where these foods will end up - whether in the Kyiv region or in Kherson, and possibly in Mariupol, but I hope that they will reach their destination and this will help save someone's life. Thank you very much for your support

Congratulations! We express our sincere gratitude to the Samaritan's Bag project for the funds we have used to provide humanitarian assistance to people who are temporarily displaced from the fighting zone in eastern, southern and northern Ukraine. Our church accepts people both for long stays and provides shelter and accommodation. We try to provide people with everything they need: food, clothing, medicine, etc. In this difficult time for Ukraine, with God's help we do everything possible to alleviate suffering and with faith and hope in our Lord Jesus Christ to go through this difficult path! With respect and gratitude, Pastor - Valery Podyalyuk, brothers and sisters of Fr. "Evangelical Voice" Kamyanets-Podilsky, Khmelnytsky region.

We truly thank the Samaritan Bag team for their financial assistance. It is used to help refugees, including many children, and to volunteer for them. In particular, the funds were used to ensure the departure from the Chernihiv region to our House of Prayer for a group of 34 people, including 21 children. And also for their food, organization of household issues and creating comfort. For some time they were offered a separate house to live in and organized a move there. We continue to provide them with food, medicine, clothing, personal hygiene products and provide space heating (firewood). Also contributed to inpatient treatment for acute illness of a two-year-old child. Thanks to your help, we continue to be active in volunteering, accepting new refugees from different parts of Ukraine.

Dear Church, Friends and partners in the ministry, Thank you for your sacrificial heart and for your service. Thanks to your help, we were able to send products and medicines for our people to the combat zone. We also have the opportunity to evacuate in several stages. Today our churches and our homes are full of people. Thanks to your ministry we have food, clothes and necessary medicines. Your and our ministry is more relevant today than ever. That Sunday, at the end of the service, an old woman came out, she said that she went through Kyiv for 2 days, then at night she found herself in the church in Vinnytsia, 2 days later late at night she found herself in the Church in the village of Ruske Pole, When they woke up in the morning, they saw again that they were in the Church, p. Ruske Pole, Zakarpattia region - she cried and said that the Church is something incredible, here people are accepted here, well here. And this is true, our brothers go at night to the nearest cities in Romania to bring food, then we transport them to the Central cities of Ukraine from where we take people to safe places. We may not have been prepared for such circumstances, but thanks to your prayers and extraordinary support, we can do what Christ is called to do! Church of Russian Field "Renaissance" Thank you brothers and sisters for this great help! Pastor Melanchuk Mykhailo, Church of the BCE Russian Field "Renaissance"

Congratulations dear friends! 35 day of war… We are alive. Moreover, God gives us the privilege and opportunity to be His hands and care for refugees and the needy. During all the days of the war, the Church of Grace in Dubrovytsia, together with our daughter churches, serves the needy. Serves those who moved to our lands from dangerous places of hostilities, large and poor. Serves the ministry of the Good Samaritan in word and deed! Thank you to the good people who prepared us for this in this difficult time for us. We pray with tears and thank God for YOU, thank you for being with us. Every day we have contacts with many needy people. People come without special invitations and announcements. Some escaped and ran out of the house. Therefore, for them such help is very valuable and important. God simply gives us the honor to manifest His ministry in these days and to be the transmitters of God's love. In addition to material concerns, we are very excited to be able to speak the gospel of salvation. Anyone could receive the New Testament or the Bible. People come and go in tears, but with great gratitude for their care. Knowing the gospel, we understand more and more deeply - love will overcome evil, and light will overcome darkness.

First of all, we would like to sincerely thank you for your generosity. In difficult times of war, funds are needed more than ever. Your gift is very valuable to our church. Our church was able to receive refugees and provide them with food and shelter. We have heard many stories from the settlers about what they experienced at the epicenter of the fighting. My heart rejoices that we can share in the needs of migrants. Our church is located in the west of Ukraine, God bless us with the opportunity to serve for those who have moved from the central and eastern part of our country. We also had the opportunity to buy the necessary food to have a stockpile at the church. We use this stock to help people in the church who are in need. Also with these products we serve for people outside our church - for people who need food. The war continues, so we try to meet the needs of the people around us. We also pray for God's guidance in our work at this difficult time. May the Lord abundantly bless your life and ministry!

Thank you very much for your help! We were able to buy food, keep the people who live in our church in the basement, and most importantly, we have the opportunity to distribute the product among non-believers in our area. Invite people to church and help in the church. Thanks to your help, we can provide people with one-time funds for pharmacies and products. May God bless you abundantly !!!

The funds were distributed to people who left their homes and who needed food, housing and financial assistance. Our family, church and village sheltered more than 1,000 people. People felt that they were needed and that they were not abandoned, they were taken care of. This is a good testimony for the church, now people are more open to the gospel. Thank you very much for your participation in our plight.

The Church of the Living God was founded and is a direct sponsor and curator of the orphanage, which operates in the village of Onufriyivka. It is a non-governmental institution and exists only through donations. Disaster came to our country and our war began. It changed our usual lives. The children switched to distance learning (online school). Constant air alarms. But the help of people like you has done everything possible so that they do not feel the full force of the war: the child lives in a wonderful place (it is a protected area, pays utility bills, warmth and comfort, we have improved some showers, replaced bedding, bought a new one) , they are constantly cared for: developmental classes, music and sports classes, English classes, Bible lessons and communication. Children have new clothes, medicines, regular food, decent treatment. In such conditions we do not change our traditions. We celebrate birthdays, give an individual cake (children blow out candles and make a wish). We give gifts and we pray that God will preserve them and our country. Children should not feel in danger even during the war and you and I make it possible!

Mother and children, refugees from the city of Mariupol, moved to the city of Mirgorod. As mother Natasha Bondarenko says: - The children and I sat in the cellar for a long time during the bombing and now our family has been evacuated to a safe place of residence. We reported about God's love. We managed to give them gifts for the children and our mobile phone number, at home the children unpacked the boxes and sent the photo to our phone (since it was handing in the queue where they stood to register at the TsNAP.)

Thanks to the funds you have listed, our church EHB s. Basharivka was able to buy food kits for refugees on the territory of our village council. And also thanks to the gifts of the "Samaritan Bag" we had the opportunity to give a smile to children who have seen so much grief. May God bless your work

We thank the Lord and donors for supporting our people. Now people need both food and other household items. DMRBO "ESTER", together with the Interfaith Evangelical Church of Christ began to purchase food and hygiene products for people who are temporarily displaced from other cities of Ukraine. Teenagers who took Christ on a plane this year before the war also joined in the collection of packages. This is the beginning of their service to God and neighbor. Thanks again. Bless you!

From the first days of the war, the New Life Church, together with a volunteer center, began to help internally displaced persons. Housing assistance, one family was settled in the church, potatoes, onions, and hygiene items, medicines were purchased. At this difficult time, believers have the opportunity to show the love of Christ in action. Free lunches are held every day in the church.

First of all, the fact that we have been able to receive these finances is already a great blessing and a testimony that God hears our prayers and blesses us. We were able to serve the refugees we took into our homes. 6 families (12 adults and 21 children) were admitted, provided with food, hygiene and clothing. Working with the social service, having lists of refugees in our area, we were able to buy food packages and the necessary things for them. In the shelter of school premises bought equipment, things that were needed.

We greet you! We are from the city of Berdyansk, the Church of the City of Refuge. We are very grateful for your financial contribution to our ministry. On February 24, war broke out in our country. Since March, we began to accept refugees from Mariupol in our church, people were bombed and many lived in basements. People came hungry and exhausted. We were able to take in 130 people a day, take care of them, feed them 3 hot meals a day, provide them with warm rooms and hot showers. With your finances, we were able to buy an electric stove to cook food, since the gas was turned off in our city. We were able to buy a large freezer in which we can store food and prepare preparations for the future. Purchase food to help refugees and needy local families. Because the city is now in a deep crisis, there are no jobs. We bought fuel and were able to take about 200 people from Berdyansk to Zaporozhye. Since March 15, we have received and fed about 700 people. We continue to help and take care of IDPs, large families and the elderly. We continue to take refugees from Berdyansk and Mariupol to Zaporozhye. Thank you very much for your concern and support.

Thank Jesus Christ, it is difficult and even impossible to describe what is happening in the heart, what words can describe the eyes of people who fled from death and saw death near the explosions, those who saw the shot cars with families, children in the middle and thanked God, it's not their family. The eyes of people who have nowhere to go because they were hit in the house, the property they collected all their lives disappeared or stolen, these are the views that look into the void, I do not know if there is a phrase in your dialect "gray faces", which shows hopelessness and helplessness in which there is no desire to live on. We have seen such eyes of people since the first days of the war. For me, the first days were shocking, I woke up to the news that the war had begun, and explosions could be heard very far away outside the window. My five-year-old son slept soundly nearby, his wife was pale with fear, what happened in the first hours could not be described in words, it cannot be called fear or panic, it is something deeper and more uncontrollable, something incomprehensible is happening to your body, your mind is not can perceive nothing adequately. I do not know how people who do not have God in their hearts survived these first days. I have been serving in the Church for 15 years and only in those days I felt the special presence of God, who gave me the strength to calm myself, to calm the family, the church, to start making some decisions. In the days to come, our Church became exhausting, we helped set up a bomb shelter by donating church property with mattresses, benches, utensils, bedding, and food. In the House of Prayer were organized 30 places for migrants who came, Gostomel, Bucha, Vorzel, Irpin, I think these cities echo in every country along with Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and others. Since we held teen camps every year, we prepared summer rooms, there are about 100 more places to receive people, these places could serve as hospitals for our soldiers, we counted the most difficult events and prepared for the worst. It's amazing how local entrepreneurs came out to meet us, we bought boilers, showers, washing machine, for a comfortable stay with us, local people brought food, enveloping the care of everyone who came. During the month of the war, we sheltered 30 people, and they live with us, and many people come by road to rest, eat, wash and continue on the road. Thanks to our large Christian family, we help families, migrants with children who came to our village, people lost their jobs, and the need for baby food, medicine, diapers for children remains, from the stress of the mother lost milk, children from stress sick, and men at war, or in defense. And the Church here has been able to help the local OTG in helping such families as never before. Delivery of diapers, purchase of medicines, baby food, fruit, food, this is what we are doing now. The Bible says that strong people are born in difficult times. We now have no fear, neither in preaching the Word of God, nor in working with people, all the doors are open, there is no such family, institution, organization where we are not waiting. The eyes of the people who came to us in the first days were changed by hope, strength, faith in God and people who serve each other. In our village, wherever our members of the Church come, for weaving nets, cooking, baking for soldiers, first of all, prayer and the Word of God are heard. Thank you for your help so that our children can live!

Dear brothers and sisters, partners of the Good Samaritan Bag - New Generation Church in Marhanets, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for your sensitive, merciful, generous heart and help in this difficult time of war for us. Your help helped visit hundreds of people with food and medicine packages (orphans, widows, large families, refugees, the disabled, retirees, etc.). We also regularly feed people in the neighborhoods, handing out gospels and prayers. Your help has also helped the churches in other cities that are currently under occupation by the aggressors (Melitopol, Vasylivka, Energodar). The help has helped in situations of people with asthma, thyroid and other diseases. In general, people with tears met with every help, there are cases of repentance before God. Glory to Jesus Christ for you, for everything you are doing at this time for Ukraine!

Elena's family, came from Nikolaev. Their residential area was bombed by Russian troops and they managed to get out and get to our city. Having no relatives, not knowing the city, they were left alone with adversity, but there is a God who always leads where we are needed. The family was provided with everything necessary (care items, food, medicine). I heard the news of God and His mercy.

Today we had the opportunity to buy and assemble 20 food kits (potatoes, oil, pasta, cereals, sugar, flour, salt, tea) and hygiene products for people from the village of our area. It is a small village and is home to many single grandparents. They do not have public communication with the city, shops do not work. So there is a great need for help. We are sincerely grateful to the Samaritan Bag project for financial support. Because now we have the opportunity to help not only in our city and nearby villages, but also to travel around the area with help. We want to tell about one grandmother who touched our hearts in this village. Approaching one yard, we called the hostess. An old grandmother came out to us. When she saw us, she was embarrassed at first, but we met and told her who we were and what help we had brought. She began to cry, hugging us with the words: "kids, I'm so glad we're not abandoned, I was so afraid that we were forgotten." She said that she had no potatoes, no oil, no cereals in the house ... her neighbor shared a little with her, but there was a family there and there was not much wealth. She cried and hugged us with the words: that God heard her and looked after them once they came and brought exactly what she did not have.

When we hear stories of evacuation of people from hot spots, our heart sympathizes and we stand in prayer ... But a much greater range of feelings, more prayers, more tears when you need to evacuate your friends, family, friends and you are powerless ... My name is Yana , I am a member of the regional Nikolaev PRD team and I want to tell the certificate. My relatives lived in the settlement near the city of Nikolaev, about these inhabitants in news there was no word. But on February 24 in our region they were the first to receive blows, because the airfield that was shelled is 3 km away. From the first day of the war, they left their homes and lived in cellars, because the shelling did not stop day or night ... and then foreign troops came to them, brought order. From the first day we tried to keep in touch at least sometimes, but it was a few words every few days ... the connection was turned off ... there was no light, the phone was sometimes charged from the car battery ... We were ready to follow them , but the road between New Odessa and Nikolaev was closed for two weeks, it was also seized, there were shellings. And people trying to break through were fired upon. So we prayed and God did what He promised in His word: And to Him Whose power works in us, and Who can do much more than we ask or even think, Ephesians 3:20 NRP He did more than we asked. Our relatives were without electricity, without delivering food to the store, they lived in a damp cellar, but He took care of health, life, children ... On March 18, a bomb was dropped in the village, 500 meters from my aunt's house. And the yard was destroyed by air shelling. There is no connection, they gather and run to leave the village, and God at the same time gives us the idea to gather and follow them. Approaching the city of Nikolaev, we saw clouds of smoke, God showed His mercy, because the explosion from which there was smoke did not happen when we passed nearby, hit in half an hour in the building near which we go ... in the settlement we could take away an elderly woman left alone and in need of care, a family with a visual impairment who had no way to evacuate, the family of my aunt and uncle with children ..and all this time we gathered people in the village was quiet, the shelling began when we went out and heard the sounds of shelling again ... God is wonderful ... He is incredible ... He always answers in time. We thank the project for financial assistance for our church. Thanks to the help we received, we were able to buy the necessary medicines and care and hygiene products for Galina's grandmother. She lives in the family of our co-coordinator for Ludmila's education. We were also able to provide visually impaired families with clothing and food, and deliver them to the center where people with visual impairments live. They were also able to pick up two families of their relatives and help them with clothes, because they ran out of their houses only with documents ... On this day 5 more families were able to leave this village. We were able to buy everything they needed for the first time and find families sheltered them in their homes. May the Lord bless you for your hearts open to help

We are very grateful to you for these finances, with which our church could serve many people who are now in a very difficult situation. With these funds, our friends could deliver bread to areas where there is no way to buy bread and other food products, this is the village of Belokuzminovka, Kramatorsk district. And also, these finances helped us distribute more than 100 food packages to needy people and migrants from Lisichansk, Severodonetsk, Volnovakha, Maryinka and many other cities and villages where fighting is taking place. People were very grateful and with tears in their eyes thanked for the help. Through this, they felt God's love, and that there are still people who care about their lives. Glory to our Lord for His boundless love and long-suffering towards us sinful people! And thank you for your financial assistance in the cause of evangelism and ministry to people in difficult life circumstances during the war.

Our church has 22 members of the church, a quarter of them are elderly and disabled, a couple of families with many children. When a brutal war broke out in our country, which destroyed cities and villages, ruthlessly killing people and children. People hid in basements without means of subsistence, without products. Our churches began to work fruitfully, brothers did not spare their transport, and even sacrificing their lives carried food and various assistance, and took people back. We also did not stand aside, preparing food for the refugees who moved to our village. And because our church is small and our financial situation is not great, we asked God for financial help. Having applied to you for help and received an answer, we were very HAPPY that we will be able to continue to serve more and more for the victims. We began to prepare more finished products, stack food packages. We thank you and God for such help. May God bless you that your sacrifice was a blessing to the people. After all, you not only helped to feed people, but also to save human life, because having many stories that people died of hunger and thirst. God bless you !!! We work non-stop. God stop this war??

Thanks to you, our church was able to organize itself, we bought food, we actively remove people from the hottest spots, resettle migrants, send trains and buses to the west, feed all those in need, calm down, pray, and resettle them in hospitals. Your finances were spent on fuel for evacuation, on the delivery of humanitarian cargo from western Ukraine, on medicines, and also a little support for the brothers from our volunteer team who, without exaggeration, risk their own lives. (Matthew 5:16) 16 So let your light shine before people, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in Heaven. Thank you for your support, you helped us to bring a good light.

date: 03. 04.22. In the amount of: 195.20. Bought products for migrants Solnechnogorskaya st., 78, Kharkiv, Kharkiv region date: 04. 04.22. In the amount of: 168.50. Bought products for migrants Solnechnogorskaya st., 78, Kharkiv, Kharkiv region Certificate. When this family fled from Kharkiv 2 cars, there were 10 of them, including 3 small children and a paralyzed man, they fled, still did not know where to go, just to get away from the bombing. But it so happened, not so far from our city of Myrhorod, their cars broke down, and now they have settled in our city. We testify to them about God's protection and His protection, and they accept our words because they are very scared. They decided to be in our city. Some members of this family are already coming to the meeting. We bought them products. Asked about their needs. Since they have children, and they do not have any baby carriages. We asked the Lord in prayer for their needs. We turned to other churches, and now we were able to give them a pram. They also need drugs that are not available in our city now, and there is already an answer. In another city already bought, will be delivered by mail soon. We see how soon God hears and answers. We are thankful to God that the money received from the Samaritan Bag has helped us to serve these people. Thank God!

God's peace to you. Thank you very much for your financial support. We want to share the story of one woman. "Olena is 52 years old with cancer, the disease is progressing, metastases in the spine and bones. The poor woman suffers from constant pain every day, almost does not get up, because every movement brings unbearable pain. And the worst thing is that So an old friend took her in. To care for such a patient requires many different special items, one of the most important was the anti-decubitus mattress. We decided to bless her and testify to God's love for her. Tears of gratitude came to Elena's eyes God probably loves me very much, because he sends me good people in life. "

Churches of Ukraine accept refugees and arrange for further settlement in better conditions. They handed over bulletproof vests to the CEE regional association and received humanitarian aid collected in western Ukraine. The guys are very sick at the forefront. So we buy medicine and hand over a gas stove with a cylinder.

The help received by our church is aimed at helping IDPs who temporarily live in our community, which is 397 people, as of April 4, 2022, we expect another 150 people. First of all, in the first stage (the photo report of which we submit) we purchased and formed food kits, personal hygiene kits, detergents for 80 people living in our dormitory. The next step is to direct funds for the purchase of household appliances (microwave ovens, multicookers, refrigerators, washing machines, electric kettles), utensils (pots, cups, plates). And in the third stage, we will provide assistance to IDPs who rent private buildings and also need our support. Among IDPs, we have about 50 children under the age of 16. At the individual request of parents we buy diapers, baby food. Many IDPs seek help in purchasing medicines. We truly thank you for your help. This is a great support for IDPs, this is a great work that you have helped us to deal with. May the good you have done return to you a hundredfold. Peace, good to you and God's blessings !!!

Dear partners We greet you, glory to the Lord Jesus Christ! First of all, we would like to express our gratitude to you all for your open heart in understanding our tragedy in Ukraine and for your support of our people! Thank you very much, only real people who have love and faith in God in their hearts can do this! We have received your financial blessing, which every day serves to help those in need and people in difficult situations in Ukraine. From the very beginning of the war and the invasion of the Russian army, ordinary people began to leave the combat zones as well as the cities, which the enemy fired from heavy equipment, bombed with planes and rockets. Our city of Korosten was no exception, and many women and children began to run away from the city in the hope of leaving for countries neighboring Ukraine. Poland has become such the closest friendly country for our citizens, for which we are very grateful. At this difficult moment, we, the church, began to take women and children to the border with Poland in private cars. It was very difficult, because the city has a curfew from evening to 6.00 in the morning, which meant that we could take people out only after this time. There were always more people than we could seat, then we opened the trunks of the cars and carried people in the trunks. People were in disarray, and when they found themselves in the car or in the trunk, there was a certain joy in front of people that they would not be left behind and they would go to the border. For one trip, we took out about 50 people - women and children. In total, during the active export, we took out at least 250 - 300 people, although this is not the whole number, we did not count .... Today, there are also trips, but single ones. The road took in one direction and the other almost 900 km. Already on the way, in cars, we passed many military posts, where we were constantly checked who we were taking and where, and rightly so! We were then recognized at the posts and treated more loyally. All the people in the cars prayed sincerely, some accepted Jesus and confessed Him as Lord and Savior! When we arrived at the border, everyone had a sense of security and joy, everyone thanked and promised everyone to return home to Ukraine! During transportation, we did not photograph anyone, especially transport, as there was always information of sabotage that the enemies were looking for and hunting for people who were leaving Ukraine. Yes, and it was very painful to see the separation of husband and wife, father and children, with tears in their eyes, who saw off their relatives and friends, while they themselves remained at home .... In addition to the fact that people were always taken out, I remember another case that left a big imprint on my heart for me. This incident happened when, once again, we delivered a batch of people to the border, I was returning home. That time we drove back empty, although we always tried to take humanitarian aid to the city along the way. At one of the checkpoints, after checking, the military asked me to bring one person who had to go another 20 kilometers. And this is on my way. I agreed and this man got into the car and we were driving. We talked, got acquainted, his name was Andrei, he was 65 years old. After a short acquaintance, he began to tell where he was and the reason that he was away from home. But he expressed this in the phrase - I have three sons, one in the land, one in prison and the third with a machine gun at a checkpoint .... As it turned out, a tragedy occurred in his house. At the beginning of the war, two brothers quarreled and one killed the other in a litter. The one who killed was buried, and the one who killed in prison. So Andrey's father went to his son in prison to give food - all the same, fatherly love. The third son defends our homeland Ukraine, and now, the heart of father Andrey, overflowing with grief and worry for each son, pours into my car .... At this moment I understand and I myself am filled with experiences together with Andrey, at this moment I feel how the Holy Spirit fills the car, and He begins to console Father Andrey in his grief. God gave special words of consolation to him, we prayed, Andrey, in a prayer of repentance, accepted Jesus Christ, and when we were already approaching the crossroads, where Andrey had to get off, I knew for sure that Andrey was no longer alone, he was in his heart with Jesus, but this means that for Andrey there will always be consolation and peace in any difficulties. When Andrei got out of the car, I was driving and crying, Andrei's pain was transferred to my heart, but I rejoiced and thanked the Lord that I could serve Andrei, that the Holy Spirit could comfort him, support and reconcile with Jesus. On that day, I realized that my main task was not just to once again deliver people to the border, but to meet with Andrey! In addition to the expenses associated with the transportation of people, and this is refueling cars, repairing and servicing cars, we serve: - we purchase medicines for the sick, pensioners, the disabled - we purchase food for those who stayed in the city and are unable to eat. - we buy food for people in our city who stayed and are in places of deprivation of liberty. (these are people who are part of our church who accepted Christ and the church serves them) - we buy food for gypsies who, due to lack of documents, cannot leave Ukraine. (these are also people as part of our church who accepted Christ and the church serves them) - we purchase food for people who remained in the rehabilitation center With great gratitude and respect for your ministry Pastor of the Pobeda Church in Korosten Mikhail Marinets

Congratulations dear friends! Thank you very much for the provided funds ... Thanks to them we were able to prepare food, bake rolls for migrants from Mariupol, Kharkiv, Irpin, Energodar and other cities of Ukraine ... We also brought food to the border with Moldova where we treated refugees who stayed for a long time. queued with the children and were hungry. One boy David was bought clothes and shoes (he is an orphan, lives with his grandmother). We truly thank God and you for your financial help that we can help our brothers and sisters in the faith (refugees), as well as many unbelieving Ukrainians in such a terrible war ... May God bless you abundantly !!!

Thanks to the Samaritan God and Bag, the proceeds go to support those people and children who were particularly affected by the war, who lost loved ones and homes and everything they had for a happy life. The finances are spent on food, medicine, hygiene products, clothes, various things for children, which are delivered to the places of residence of those people who need it in our region. Depending on the possibility of delivery, we send food and medicine to places where hostilities are taking place (Kyiv, Chernihiv). Let's help with fuel for evacuation. We thank the Samaritan Bag and its president, Franklin Graham, for their prayerful and material assistance. Special thanks to our Rivne region team for their support, organization and work. Bless all God by giving Peace and care to the needy.

Welcome. We thank God and the Samaritan Bag for the funds that came to help set up refugee families in our area. Since most families arrived with almost nothing, all families who needed clothes, products, some utensils, electric stoves, etc. were provided for. Some families could not even buy bread, let alone something else. In this difficult time, helping people, testifying to them about Jesus, we invite them to serve in the House of Prayer. People come with their children to watch and then have communication, give children gifts, some New Testaments. Everyone thanked them, and the children waited until they got home, opened the presents and were very happy that they got what they needed. People are surprised that complete strangers treat them so well and help in this difficult time. Currently, we are going to arrange another family. Thank you very much. God's blessings.

Congratulations brothers and sisters! First of all, I would like to thank you for the funds you have sent to the Light of Life Church in Zhashkiv. Thanks to your support, we were able to help many people, support them financially and spiritually. We very much appreciate your support at such a difficult time for Ukraine. From the very first days of the war, our church did not sit still. Together with our mother church, we began to work actively to help the military. From many individuals and entrepreneurs, we received products and basic necessities, which were transferred to the front. We were actively involved in cooking stews and porridges for the military. However, we later saw that there was a great need for migrants from the temporarily occupied and frontline zones. According to rough data, between 2,000 and 3,000 people arrived in Zhashkiv. These are internally displaced persons. More than half of these people were from Kyiv and the surrounding area, namely Boyarka Vyshhorod, Irpin, Bucha, Boryspil, Brovary, Vasylkiv, and Chernihiv. Also people who came from the eastern and southern directions of Ukraine. On March 12, we started distributing food kits to IDPs in Zhashkiv. It was when you provided the funds that it was a good impetus to increase the amount of assistance in this area. From March 12 to April 6, we distributed 580 food kits. We did not stop there. Twice a week we distribute food kits in the amount of approximately 140-150 pieces. for migrants and needy locals. We also provide the opportunity to receive clothing and spiritual support from the church. With the onset of warming in Ukraine, many people approached us and asked for spring clothes, because many people left the war zone in warm, winter clothes, taking nothing with them. We also help people when they need food and hygiene. In addition, we decided to make a little surprise for women and girls, together with a local entrepreneur who partially donates flowers to us. We understand that we are doing the right thing when we see smiles and tears of happiness in people who have gone through war, who have seen destruction, death, thus giving them a little ray of hope and peace. Also, we do not forget to please the children by giving them gifts from the Samaritan's bag, which we could not distribute before the war. It is very nice that many local people provide us with various products so that we can then distribute them to people. One of the directions of our church was to support the families of local soldiers who are at war. According to the people to whom we passed these food kits, this is a great support for their families and children who do not see their husbands and fathers. Today, our church actively cooperates with the local administration, which provides us with lists of IDPs so that we can help them. We do not plan to stop our work and are ready to serve God and people. Thank you very much for your support. We will definitely win! May God bless you! I threw you only five photos, but they are not enough to describe all our activities. If you need, I can download additional photos and stories of people who experienced the occupation or evacuation. Sincerely, Kuts Oleksandr, a minister of the Light of Life Church.

Thank you for the money (which is very necessary for us) at this difficult time for the whole country. Our church has been accepting refugees since the first day of the war, and the conditions in the rented premises at the beginning of the war were not very good. Thanks to good people like you, we were able to buy the necessary things to meet the refugees. At the expense of the Samaritan's Bag, we bought a clothes dryer and a washing machine. Thank you very much for your care and concern for us! People who leave the hot spots of Ukraine are in great need of love and peace, getting to us they get love and care! Bless you in your work!

Good day. Our team wants to express to our partners the "Samaritan's bag". The gratitude you have given us, She has helped and is helping us a lot. Thank you, God, for taking part in helping us, our Ukraine. Thank you, we were able to buy Diz for car, to bring children to Floorball classes, we also had the opportunity to tell them the Gospel, to teach them the course of the greatest journey. Many children have left the fighting and are in our area. Also we, (my family was able to receive people who came to us, Live… were able to serve them, home, bathroom, food that we bought, and continue to buy.) We continue to serve in the future, here in the place where we live. Together with you, with the Lord Jesus Christ, we will defend our freedom. The freedom that Russia wants to steal, to kill our enemy. Be blessed. May the Lord bless you in your ministry.

22-24.03.2022. Departure to Kharkiv. This was the first trip since the start of a full-scale war in Ukraine. We left in three cars, took different things - diapers, baby food, food, blankets, sleeping bags, medicine. They brought it all to the Catholic community - the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Kharkiv, where our brothers delivered food and things to different areas for local residents of the city. When they returned, 12 women and children were taken out of Kharkiv, mattresses were laid on the floor of a cargo bus, and so they were taken to Bar. Unfortunately, the photos were few because they were unloaded quickly that day because it was a bit dangerous, the artillery volleys were well heard. We left the city in the evening, and at night we bombed Merefa, a suburb of Kharkiv, through which we drove in and out of the city.

Bought products for migrants Solnechnogorskaya ul., 78, Kharkiv, Kharkiv region for the Yurchenko family date: 04.04.22 in the amount of: 630.00. Bought Medicines, diapers and more for migrants Solnechnogorskaya ul., 78, Kharkov, Kharkov region for the Yurchenko family (the purchase was made in the Dnieper city, checks for payment they did not keep, we gave them 630 UAH for gasoline, although the drug cost much more). Testimony We want to add another family fleeing from near Kharkov 2 cars, there were 10 people, including 3 small children and a paralyzed man, they fled, still did not know where to go, just to get away from the bombing. They settled in the same house, but as Yurchenko Raisa testifies: "--When we arrived in Myrhorod, we could not find housing for our large family, because 10 of us came. I just sat on the asphalt near the road, I cry and beg God for help. And one woman saw that I was crying. She asked me, "What's the matter?" you will live in my house, and I will live in my children. And so we live I0 people all together. " But this is not all God's mercy for this family. Yes, as her husband is paralyzed and he needs medicine, ointments, diapers, and the pharmacy does not, and the money ran out, but thank God, if God gave a stroller for their family, we were able to find out that in the city of Dnieper diapers and medicine, and there was a volunteer who bought it all and brought it at his own expense, we just blessed him and gave him 630 hryvnias for gasoline. When we brought them medicine, diapers and food, Raisa and their whole family were very grateful. But we know that God does it all. Glory to Him!

In our village, thank God, there was no concrete fighting, so we do our best to help those who need help. The funds provided to us by the Samaritan's Bag were used to purchase and send bread to hotspots. With your help, we also took away 8 tons of potatoes for refugees, which were accepted by churches in Lviv and Lutsk. We also purchase and assemble food packages, which we distribute to IDPs living on the territory of Loknytsia and Zarichne OTGs. For the children of migrants, we give gifts from the Samaritan Bag and, if necessary, buy them clothes and other necessary things. We truly thank everyone who is involved in financial assistance for us. May God bless you abundantly and reward you a hundredfold. Peace to you and your families!

After the war, we opened a volunteer center on the basis of our church and converted some rooms for his needs (the library became a food warehouse, etc.). Our first services were to take mothers and children abroad and to help the soldiers of the Armed Forces. Then we were able to serve food and hygiene products to families with young children, large families and children with disabilities, migrants and the elderly with small pensions. We also had the opportunity to buy medicines and disinfectants for hospitals and hospices in our region. These days we have imported food to the villages of our region that were under occupation or were fired upon by the enemy. Preaching the gospel is an important part of our ministry. We are grateful to God for the opportunity to serve our people at such an important time. It is a great blessing to see how open people are now to the Good News. We still have many photos and testimonies from our ministry, but due to lack of space and ethical reasons, not all of us can show yet. We also organized several meetings for children, where gifts from the Samaritan's Bag were given and a Bible lesson was given. We are planning several more such meetings. We are sincerely grateful to everyone who helps us financially in these ministries!

Dear friends, ministers of the Samaritan Bag Mission. Your help was very timely - we had the means to help refugees and churches, it was a great blessing from the Lord. Our church is located in the city of Kropyvnytskyi, it is the very center of Ukraine and therefore we were almost not under fire, but could serve as a transshipment base for those who fled the horrors of war. With the money we received from you, we equipped a special shelter for refugees, could buy medicine and food for a large number of people who passed through the church, low-income people from the church received food kits, which helped a lot, we repaired cars of refugees who broke down. road to the west. And we were able to refuel cars that brought humanitarian aid. We are very grateful to you, may God bless you abundantly!

You are a great blessing to us. With these funds we can help people who have lost their homes, they have lost everything and now they need to help from dishes to food and so we can invite them to church, buy medicine for people who do not have such an opportunity because it is too expensive, also help our military and volunteers. Were it not for your help, we would not have had such an opportunity. And this is only a small part, there are still many needs and wants, because many people who have lost their homes, sick, widows. These means have shown us that God does not forsake his own. We bless you!

Dear sponsors of the "Samaritan's Bag" project! We truly thank you for your financial contribution to the activities of our church during the war. Our church members donated food and other items to those in need, and volunteers delivered them in their own cars to places of greatest need. Your money covered most of the cost of fuel and some essentials. Our volunteers conducted more than ten humanitarian flights to Kyiv and the region and evacuation flights on the way back. Your financial participation has helped us to serve those people who were in dire need of food and moving to safe places. This need remains and we continue to work for the good of our country. Sincerely, EHB Church Ostrozhets.

Evidence of two families who had to be evacuated several times from the Russian bombing. This is the family of Manukyan Mikhail and his wife Arevek and Mazelevsky Sergei and his wife. For the first time in 1989. from Nagorno Karabakh to Gorlovka, then these families together in 2014. fled from the bombing of the same Russia in Constantinople. And now they have children, and they had to flee to us in Myrhorod. And they already know what war is, they don't want and they don't want their children to go through what they had to go through. They are grateful that their children received gifts, and they were grateful for the food for their families, which we led, they came to the service. They reported that they felt the love of Jesus through fellowship. They have a Bible that they read and believe in God. Thank God for everything!

The second trip to Kharkiv took place on March 28, 2022. for which I am infinitely grateful to the Christmas Child Project. The second trip was calmer, because there were fewer and further explosions. Although there were some incidents because one of the four cars broke down a bit - the rear shock absorber broke due to the load and the broken roads in some places, but thank God everything went well little by little)). Unloaded cars and back home, you need to leave early because the city is curfew.

Thank God for the Samaritan's Bag project for supporting the Ukrainian churches during this difficult time of war. The funds we have received are a great blessing to many people whom the church has been able to serve with your support. Our people from the east often took to leaving their homes taking only the most necessary things, so when they are with us, they are not given the opportunity to rest, eat, need clothes for personal hygiene. Many people stay abroad for several days. There are families who stay for a long time, we look for housing and help with food and other things. At this time, people were left without finances and could not buy even the most necessary medicines, there are families where young children and parents are now out of work, there are seriously ill people who need money for treatment, so part of the money was transferred to families need. We cooperate with the local military enlistment office and, at their request, provide lunches for conscripts, fuel and hygiene, and socks. One thermal imager was transferred. Thanks to your support, many people have experienced God's love in action. Thank you, may God bless and preserve everyone who is part of your team. May the Lord give you and fulfill our heart's desires.

Greetings friends and co-workers in the cause of God. We inform you that in the period from the beginning of hostilities on the territory of Ukraine from February 24, 2022, the Ark of Salvation Church in Alexandria accepted, accommodated, provided food, accommodation and necessary assistance to 115 people from the East of Ukraine + 14 pets. Basically, these are families and individuals from Mariupol, Melitopol, Slavyansk, Zaporozhye, Kharkov. People are forced to flee from hostilities in order to find a safe place for themselves. Our church personally took part in the evacuation of 10 people from Mariupol. This happened on the 20th day of the war, when the city was already under constant shelling, and many people lost their homes and were forced to stay in the basement. For the evacuation, we were able to organize and refuel the transport, which first took 2 families from Mariupol to a safe place in Berdyansk. And then, a few days later, the transport was sent for the other two families, who were also evacuated to Berdyansk, then to Zaporozhye, then to the Dnieper, and from the Dnieper we were able to take these people to Alexandria. This is an elderly couple who are 73 years old. The war deprived these people of their apartment, in which they had lived for 45 years, and of all their property. We were able to accommodate these people in one of the rooms of our house, provide them with psychological and moral support, pay for their treatment and provide them with everything necessary for later life. Today, thanks to your financial support, the Church is working in several directions. 1. Work with immigrants who left the East and stopped in Alexandria for an indefinite period. Basically for such people - we provide assistance in the formation and distribution of food packages, diapers and baby food to those who have small children. 2. Work with migrants who are transiting through Alexandria to Western Ukraine and further to Europe For such people, we mainly provide accommodation, meals, and help some of them to refuel transport. 3. Working with military people We try to provide medicines to such people. 4. Work with the local population who find themselves in difficult circumstances and below the poverty line. Basically, we try to help families with food packages. Dear friends, we are very grateful to you for your prayers, care and financial assistance to serve the people who suffered in the war from Russian aggression on the territory of Ukraine. We will be glad to continue to do the Work of God together with you! With respect and prayer, Pastor Alexander Lysov

sincerely greet you, dear brothers and sisters, with the love of our Lord Jesus Christ! Thanks to your financial support, our organization buys products for cooking and baking bakery products within a month, where our friends can transfer them to places where people need a piece of bread! Every day, our team prepares and bakes products to support people who have been left without food. Our brothers take it away and give it away! We are extremely grateful for such help and believe that God will give you a hundredfold for all your good deeds. Thanks to you, we are able to feed thousands of people! May God abundantly bless everyone involved. We pray for you and bless in the name of the Lord!

Many thanks to the Christmas Child Project for providing financial assistance at this difficult time for Ukraine. A volunteer team from our church works with refugees. who came to our city of Ostrog, and also received people who continued their way further to the West. Now on the basis of the church they can receive humanitarian aid: clothes, food packages (photos) temporarily displaced persons, also prepare dinners for them. We took people from Kharkiv (photo), and also brought humanitarian aid (photo) and medicines (photo) to Kharkiv. Of course, we do not stop there, we plan to hold a children's camp for refugee children. We pray for this and for God to expand our possibilities. May God abundantly bless you !!!

Dear brothers and sisters! Thank you very much for your prayerful and financial support. We used the funds you transferred for transportation and reception of refugees. They bought them groceries and basic necessities. They also bought and handed over products to our citizens who are in the territory where the hostilities are taking place. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine continues, the needs have not decreased. If you have the desire and opportunity to help more, we will be grateful. God bless you!

We are in the rear, so we accept a large number of refugees from Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Kharkiv, Trostyanets, Mariupol, Chuguev, Okhtyrka. But they did not forget about their fellow villagers who one day found themselves without work and without means of subsistence. Before the war, we took care of socially vulnerable families with children who were registered with the social services. We had 30 such families in the district, with up to 100 children. Therefore, having received funds from the Samaritan's Bag, we took the products to such families.

Some families live in remote villages. If before they could travel by bus to the city, now the buses do not run, and they have remained completely "cut off" from the world. Also, goods in rural stores stopped coming. This turned out to be a huge problem. Since we have a car, we used the Samaritan Bag to refuel and deliver food to distant villages.

We moved this large family from the village to the city to look for at least some part-time work and live among the people. And then there are a few families left in their village, the shop is closed and they don't have a car. Even before the war, they lived below the poverty line, but the man went somewhere to make money. And now they are left naked, barefoot and without money. When we came to them with food, they had one onion and half a pack of rice on the table. That was all they had left of the food! God sent us very timely! We brought them food, and a few days later they moved to Poltava. Every week we go to Poltava for shopping, then we go to them - we ask how things are. They brought them groceries several times, washed their jackets and bedding, and took the children on weekends to distract and bathe them. One day we just got to the girl's birthday!

For the first three weeks we were afraid to come to church, but then we decided to get together, because the children already missed each other and our regular meetings on Saturdays. Everyone was very happy, we sang, prayed, did patriotic deeds and gave gifts to those who did not receive on the holiday.

This woman comes from our village, but has lived and worked in Kyiv for years. I sat there until the last, until it "flew" too close. She fled to her homeland to her relatives. After a while, a friend with a small child also came to her from Kyiv, because there was nowhere to go. Now they live here together. And we helped them with food, diapers and baby food.

This is a large family of 6 children, registered in the social service. They live very poorly, because parents not only allow themselves to drink often, but also can not provide for adult children. While they were all small, the state paid for each of them, but now it's hard. We have been going to them for more than a year, mostly before September 1, to bring stationery to school and bring fruit and sweets for the New Year. And now we got acquainted, we visit more often. Because the parents lost their jobs, as a result - hunger!

We made business cards and put them in the village council. Refugees came there to register, and they were given our business card. So the calls started to literally "pour"! I didn't have time to record and buy everyone! But to all who called, we took away a set of products and household goods.

woman from the village who took in the refugees called. Nobody lived in the house for 10 years! Two women, each with three children, sat in a basement in Kharkiv for two Sundays, and then they were given 5 minutes to run for documents and evacuate. Therefore, they had no choice: where they settled, there they went. We had a hard time getting to their house in that village, we were afraid that the car would get stuck in the swamp. They don't have water - they go to take neighbors, because the well is silted up. Heat the stove to heat water and cook food. There are thickets around the house, so there is enough firewood. The children ran to the car and began to literally pull everything out and grab everything in a row, shouting: "My name is Nadia, and then Kostya ... and what's your name?" We took the cylinder to refuel it so that they could cook on gas. I wrote about this family on Facebook so that people could help. On the same day, utensils, pots, things, toys, products for this family were brought to my work! What kind, generous, responsive people we have! God encouraged them to sacrifice. Then my peer called me and asked to give him a family he could take care of. And I gave him these people. He took the balloon from us, the next day his mother baked cakes for the children and he and his friends went to them. They refueled and connected the cylinder, cleaned the well and threw the pump in there, brought the refrigerator! and did much more men's work. And then we realized that we can connect fellow villagers to our good cause, and not take it all on. Because physically they couldn't stand this cycle anymore: buy, pack, deliver to each family.

Thank God. Thank you for your help. We buy and import diapers, baby food, hygiene products in the sanatorium where there are now IDP children in the number of 150 children aged 2 months to 15 years. We bring help with an interval of 7_10 days. We also collect social packages for people who have been temporarily relocated to our region. We provide assistance as needed to those who need it. We pray that God will help you in your work.

There is now a great need to help others. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the village of Ploska partially uses funds for the production of porridge (stew) in eastern Ukraine. A certain part was donated to families who came from hot spots and do not have the opportunity to earn a living and what to live for (this is both food and finance). The church also prepares (dumplings, cakes) for people in a mental hospital, there is a very urgent need for help. It is clear that a clear statement of the expenditure of these funds was needed here, but you will not spend all the funds at once. We try to use them as needed. We truly thank the Samaritan Bag Mission for financial assistance, we pray for you and your sincere sacrifice and help at a difficult time for us !!!

Glory to our Lord! During the war, the Church of the Holy Spirit of Mlyniv hosted 13 families from Kyiv and the region, 7 families from Kharkiv with a total number of 100 people. 75 people passed through the church in transit (stop, overnight stay and further departure abroad). The funds received from the Samaritan's Bag were used to provide the IDPs with food kits and basic necessities. Also, food kits are formed on a regular basis and taken by the brothers of our church to Kyiv; Okhtyrka, Lebedyn (Sumy region); Kharkiv.

Mother and children, refugees from the city of Mariupol, moved to the city of Mirgorod. As mother Natasha Bondarenko says: - The children and I sat in the cellar for a long time during the bombing and now our family has been evacuated to a safe place of residence. We reported about God's love. We managed to give them gifts for the children and our mobile phone number, at home the children unpacked the boxes and sent the photo to our phone (since it was handing in the queue where they stood to register at the TsNAP.) Later we met by chance with this family , since they temporarily lived with the people who sheltered them, but they were offered a job with accommodation in the city of Krivoy Rog, we managed to talk with them for just a couple of minutes, only managed to buy sweets for the children on the road. Date: 05.04. 2022., in the amount of 57, 30. bought sweets for the children for the Bondarenko family, refugees from the city of Mariupol.

Congratulations to the entire Samaritan Bag team! Peace to you! I express my gratitude on behalf of the Church of the Annunciation in the village of Novi Sanzhary, Poltava region, for your tangible support and assistance you have given to our church in its service to needy people and children in difficult times of our state. Thanks to your help, we were able to purchase food, medicine, and pay for the transportation of humanitarian aid for refugees. During this time, we provide assistance to all those who find themselves in a difficult financial situation due to the war. People receive the necessary clothes and things, as well as medicines and food packages. And most importantly, along with material assistance, we talk about the Good News and that everyone needs to make the most important choice of their lives. Thank you again for this tangible help. We pray for you and for God to strengthen you and bless you abundantly. Yours faithfully, Brother in Christ Jesus Tymoshenko Alexander

Hello, I want to provide a photo report for the money spent, and that's not all the money spent. These are families of refugees from Mariupol, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Lozova, Barvinkove, Izyum. At the discretion of the Pastor, meetings were held every Sunday for refugees, each member of the family received meat and cereals, and at home will cook what they want. The following week, food kits for oil, sugar, 4 types of cereals, pasta and tea were prepared. Refugees from the orphanage and rehabilitation home, MULTIPLE FAMILIES also received special assistance, including diapers, sweets, eggs, meat, cereals, sugar, pasta. This is only 1/3 of what we have received, every Sunday we do charitable help thanks to you, pray for YOU and Bless, thank you and the Lord. This help is very important, people are extremely grateful. on the other hand, a fire broke out because a shell hit, and the men in the basement somehow cleared the passage on the side where the blockage was, because a fire was approaching on the other side, and they helped save this mother and children, miraculously she escaped. God really is! Thank you for being able to be closer to people and to be Jesus Christ in their lives at this difficult time. ”

Dear friends, employees of the Samaritan's Bag, on behalf of the Church of Christians of the Faith of the Evangelical Faith in the village of Staryi Oleksynets, Kremenets district, Ternopil region, I express my sincere gratitude for your support in serving temporarily displaced persons, especially children. Our village and the adjacent villages of the Lopushne territorial community became a refuge for many people who were forced to leave their homes, fleeing the war. Since the beginning of the war, about 70 gifts illustrated by the New Testament and the books The Greatest Journey have been distributed to immigrant children. The funds provided by you are used for the delivery of humanitarian aid and food, for the arrangement of housing in abandoned houses. Necessary things, household appliances and other things necessary for living are purchased. Thanks to you, we can give comfort to the sad, support to the underprivileged, and tears to the weeping. A ray of joy in children's eyes, when receiving toys, gives hope that the Lord will surely help all of us and soon the long-awaited peace will come. In doing this work, we communicate with people, listen to their stories, encourage them, and invite them to worship. I would like to share one testimony given by one woman. She and her family arrived safely from Pokrovsk in our own car with children. And her niece and her two children were to follow them by train from Kramatorsk. Being at the station among the crowd, the children immediately forced their mother to step aside to the nearest shop to buy sweets. As they did so, they heard a rocket explode that landed where they had just left. God miraculously saved their lives. Thank God. In conclusion, I want to wish you all health, well-being and all the best. And to all Ukrainians - a peaceful sky over their heads. May God's blessing be with you all. And with the coming feast of Christ's Resurrection. May it be joyful and, of course, peaceful! Sincerely, Church Minister Vitaliy Malanyuk. (!)

 posted an ad on Facebook so that anyone who wanted to donate something to refugees could come to work for me (I have a large hall). People brought vegetables, canned food, utensils, things, bedding, blankets, toys, etc. Refugees make copies of my documents at work to help me. I see the postscript in the passport, do it for free and communicate. I ask where they fled from, if they are in need. And right in the lobby I give them help.

This woman came to work for us. My husband played with the child while she made copies of documents. He asked how old he was and said that we would come to them and bring the child a present. We brought them children's things, gave the boy a present, and he said, "Is this me? And for a hundred (what)?" It was so cute ...

It is good that there are caring people who want to help. A woman from a nearby village called me. She told how many families of migrants in their village, we arranged a meeting, went there, she went to the village council on a bicycle, met us, took us to each family. I thought she was the head of the village council, but it turned out not to be - she is the head of the kindergarten! Well done, not indifferent! We brought help to five different families. One: a son and a lying mother with broken legs, the second - five friends of retirees gathered and ran away, the third - teachers, even wrote a thank you - so nice, the fourth and fifth - ordinary people who sat in the basement for two weeks, thought that everything would end, and then they realized that it would not happen so quickly and left.

Today there were two grandmothers from Lysychansk, one lying 92 years old, and the other said that she cried all night because a shell hit her house at night, now she is left without a roof over her head! They also brought help and sweets to a young widow with a 5-year-old son, and she has not yet told him that her father was killed in the war because she does not know how to do it.

Fighters from fellow villagers called. They said that a 12-year-old boy Sashko, an orphan living with his grandmother, went to the checkpoint. They feed him, teach him to shoot. We gave him two bags of things, sweets, a gift and baked cakes. The guys dropped a photo where he was already in our things. I asked to take a picture of him with your gift, but they replied that he had already been evacuated from there.

The woman wrote, asked for help. This is a grandmother. The children's mother died of cancer, the father does not need them. He does not receive financial assistance for them. They live in the village, heat in winter with firewood, which they pull themselves from planting. Children play right in the ground because there is no sand.

The funds received from the Samaritan's Bag helped the EHB church in the village of Brest actively serves the people during the war. We accept migrants, provide them with food and basic necessities. We help food packages to families with children left without material support as a result of the war. Funds were allocated for the repair of minibuses, which evacuate people from "hot spots". As a result, some of the displaced people began attending our services. Praise the Lord for the fact that in such dark times the Church of Christ has the opportunity to bring light to the people and to show God's love for people in a tangible way.

Difficult times have begun in our country. But despite this, our church tries to help the needy in every possible way. Many people from the destroyed cities of Ukraine came to our area. They came with nothing. We use the Samaritan Bags to prepare charity dinners for people in need. Also, we use this money to purchase products and hygiene products for the affected residents of Chernihiv and Zaporizhia. We truly thank all the people who help with finances, prayer for our country, our people in this terrible time for us!

For us, support in financial assistance is a great blessing, during the difficult situation in Ukraine. As soon as the war began, we immediately began to act as a Church, and it was at this time that the Church had the opportunity to serve and testify even more about Jesus. And on the basis of the local Church, we created a charitable fund for humanitarian aid. People and refugees began to turn to us. We have seen that it is a great blessing to those around us. God is very blessed, help came from all over the world. Our Church is small, so we would not be able to do that. Financial support from the Samaritan Bag is a miracle and an answer to prayer. For this whole amount, we could buy products and pack "food kits" for a long time. Thank you very much and your team. May the Lord bless and reward to a great extent. May the peaceful sky be above you. God's grace to you. It's been more than a month of war. We are serving people, there were hundreds on our way, thousands of people we helped and testified of Jesus Christ. Every Sunday, new people come to our Church. Every Sunday there are people who repent. The time has come when there are not enough chairs in the church to sit on, this is a miracle for us. We are experiencing God's great grace. With God's help, we continue to serve. With love and gratitude New Life Church Dnipropetrovsk region

Good day. The North Church in Kryvyi Rih reports to you. We would like to express our gratitude to you for coming to our aid during such difficult times for us. $ 5,000 was transferred to our church, which amounted to UAH 145,689.4. Our expenses: 1) UAH 43,189.4 - food kits for refugees arriving in our city, large families, and families of SJO who visit our Christian club. 2) UAH 5,000 - for packages for food kits (products were packed and given to people) 3) UAH 2,100 - payment for medical care 4) UAH 11,000 - payment for fuel (delivery of products to places), 5) UAH 12,000 - payment for transportation of products by truck to our city 6) UAH 11,300 - purchase of fabric for bulletproof vests for our SRW fighters who protect our city from the enemy 7) UAH 2,900 - purchase of thermal underwear, socks for SRW fighters 8) UAH 3,200 - repair of washing machines in the center, which accepts up to 100 refugees 9) UAH 25,000. - billboards with passages from the Holy Scriptures (for bringing the Gospel to the people, instead of billboards with abusive words). We believe that these are very important actions when a person does not know what to hope for and where he will be after death. 10) UAH 30,000 - Easter billboards. In general, all funds were spent on purpose. Now I want to describe in more detail how you and I were able to help with these funds. Food kits: cereals, canned food, vegetables came in handy for people who came to our city without anything. It is a great joy to see the spark of gratitude and hope for humanity in their eyes. You understand that this will help them just survive the first, most difficult stages of their resettlement. Part of the funds was transferred to the church in Tsyuryupynsk (which was under siege at the time) for the purchase of food. They even sent a video of their thank you message. I will attach a photo. Our brothers took cookies to the checkpoints for our defenders, the guys are also people and sometimes, especially in cold weather, cookies become a godsend. The guys are very grateful. Products were purchased for refugees (about 100 people) living in the school. They are fed there 3 times a day. There, in this institution, they helped financially repair two washing machines, which could not cope with the work of such a large number of people. Unfortunately, many guys with SRW were understaffed even with just warm underwear, bulletproof vests, etc. When the pastor bought thermal underwear and said it was for the defenders, we were given a good discount. People are coming to meet us, everyone understands that we need to help each other, otherwise we simply will not survive. We bought fabric, threads for sewing bulletproof vests (they are made in our city) to somehow help those who protect us at the cost of their own lives. The central church of our city, together with our brothers and sisters, serves the people who come to the registration point for internally displaced persons. Together with the tent, they organized a tent free of charge, offering people waiting for their turn tea, coffee, cookies, cakes, listening to someone, testifying to someone about the Savior, and inviting them to church. The fact is that there are a lot of people who come, and sometimes they stand in line for registration for several hours. You would see their eyes looking gratefully at the people who cared for them. Since we understand that daily bread without spiritual bread is nothing, the brothers decided to spread the Word of God on billboards. Unfortunately, there are now many billboards with abusive words addressed to the Russian army and Putin. But we understand that curses are the devil's weapon. We fight with you with the weapon of our Lord - His word. Once again, we are very grateful for your help, it was a blessing for a very large number of people. May the Lord bless you and give you 1000 times

 man from Kharkiv, Volodymyr, a shell fell 100 meters from him! At our work, something rumbled somewhere, he turned "what was it ?!" - he is afraid. As I gave him everything, tears came to his eyes! I took photos underground, because it's inconvenient to harass some people ... and I continue to distribute food and household kits right at work during breaks between clients.

Your funds have helped us do a lot of help to people who are in combat zones. We mostly made finished products and imported them to cities and villages that were at the epicenter of the war and needed help. And also contacted military units and bought them essentials and medicines. And at the moment about 20 tons of aid have been sent from our church. Thank you very much for your financial support. God bless you!

Many thanks to all the staff of the Samaritan Bag Mission, to all those who joined this good cause, in very difficult times for Ukraine, the money received was spent mainly on procurement and delivery, and food distribution, especially in the occupied territories, where the real trouble is where there is no possibility to bring, we transfer funds to people in need, a large part goes to food that people come to daily prayer and then can eat, also help with medicines for those in need, a lot of help for children on nutrition and hygiene, and adults can get hygiene , and part of the funds for fuel for cars involved in this good cause. Thank you very much and thank God.

Congratulations to our Samaritan Bag partners! The religious community of the Christian Church of the Evangelical Faith "Heavenly Gift" expresses its sincere gratitude to you and thank you for your help to our church during the war with Russia. Your help is an invaluable contribution to the development of charity and, of course, tangible support to the needy and needy, people who have been forced to move to other cities, or those who lost their jobs at such a difficult time. Good deeds do not go unnoticed - they shine like beacons to those who are waiting for help. By providing help, you give not just material values, but give joy and hope for a peaceful life. May your kindness and generosity return to you a hundredfold. We wish you all the best, health, prosperity and more warmth in your life. Thanks to your financial support, people received material help and most importantly prayed the prayer of repentance, you accepted Jesus Christ into your hearts. Thanks to your support, we helped about 80 families in need of financial support. Most of these families are internally displaced persons who are forced to leave their homes. People fleeing from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kyiv regions had only documents proving their identity. An interesting testimony of the Incredible God. A family of six people: grandmother, grandfather, mother, father and two children left the Donetsk region, under God's protection they reached the Dnipropetrovsk region of Nikopol. We prepared a house with three rooms for them, where we could arrange everything, bought a device for heating water, replaced the unusable unit in the house. The family did not expect that they would be accepted like that, now we are helping with food for the family, because no one in the family is working yet, they are not receiving help from the state yet. After such help and preaching of the Gospel, the family visited churches and accepted Jesus Christ into their hearts. Thanks to your help, we were able to buy a large number of foods such as vegetables, fruits, cereals, flour, sugar, oil and more. We distributed all the products to the needy, who have now lost their jobs due to the war. A large number of large families were forced to leave Nikopol, they asked for help and asked for help because in another city where they stayed, they could only find a place to spend the night and could not buy food, so we transferred funds to families in need. It should be noted that your material support has helped people to understand not only their physical bodies but also their souls. At such a difficult time for our country, people really need basic things such as a roof over their heads, food, clothing, hygiene products, which is why your support is extremely important. Today the hearts of men are open to Christ, and in the preaching of the Gospel we are greatly helped by your financial support. Thanks to your help, the church was able to purchase the necessary equipment for the bomb shelter, which is on the territory of the church, these are: electric stoves for cooking, generator, refrigerator, necessary utensils, microwave. Unfortunately, the emotions of the people who received help cannot be conveyed in words. One 19-year-old girl who lost her job and has no support, could not believe her eyes when receiving help, cried very loudly and thanked God for your sensitive hearts. Our acquaintances told us about people who desperately needed help from Nikopol, Pokrova, Chervonohryhorivka, then we collected food packages and New Testaments and went to their home, people accepted Jesus into their hearts, some of them then attended Sunday services. , some have opened their homes to Christ and now we can come to their homes and serve their families. Thus, internally displaced persons, persons with disabilities, large families, and people who have now lost their income due to unemployment have received financial assistance.

Our ECB church in Busk, Lviv region, is small, and we gladly serve the Lord by helping others. In the bitter times when Russia invaded Ukraine, many people lost their homes without any means or means of subsistence. With the help of the Samaritan Bag, we were able to help families with food and hygiene items. For example, a family from Chernihiv received such a coveted package and sincerely thanked the Samaritan Church and Sumy for their care. They sincerely rejoiced at the food and clothing they had unfortunately lost in the war. Also, we have people with disabilities who are not immigrants, but who lost their breadwinners due to Russia's aggression. They also received food kits from us. Thanks to the funds, we support people in need at this time. Thank you and praise the Lord for your tangible help.

With your help, we were able to help and will continue to help many families who were forced to evacuate from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson regions. Transportation, accommodation, food were organized. Many people stopped temporarily and continued on their way. The pastor's family (near Melitopol) was taken out of the occupied territory of Zaporizhia region. A convoy of cars carrying the pastor's wife and three children came under fire while driving through the occupied territories. All people began to pray, the shelling stopped, people were able to evacuate. Thank you, God, for saving your life! Now this family is abroad. Organized trips by our transport with food and medicine to the villages where it is needed. There are also street meals for the needy twice a week. We help to organize accommodation and meals for people from evacuated areas who have decided to stay in our city. Thank you to your organization for your help and for your caring hearts, your prayers. May the Lord bless you! We believe in victory!

The Church "Restoration of the Tabernacle" expresses its gratitude to the "Good Samaritan" mission for the assistance provided with food, which we were able to distribute in the city of Nikolaev and Odessa. Thanks to your participation, many families, the elderly, orphans and widows, as well as families with many children, were provided with basic necessities. Good deeds will not go unnoticed - they are like beacons, shining on those who are waiting for help. We are sure that your example is indicative for other philanthropists. By helping, you give not only material values, but also joy and hope. We wish you all the best, health, more warmth on your life path. May the Lord bless you!

The Church "Restoration of the Tabernacle" expresses its gratitude to the "Good Samaritan" mission for the assistance provided with food, which we were able to distribute in the city of Nikolaev and Odessa. Thanks to your participation, many families, the elderly, orphans and widows, as well as families with many children, were provided with basic necessities. Good deeds will not go unnoticed - they are like beacons, shining on those who are waiting for help. We are sure that your example is indicative for other philanthropists. By helping, you give not only material values, but also joy and hope. We wish you all the best, health, more warmth on your life path. May the Lord bless you!

Congratulations! We truly thank everyone who donated money for our church! Since the beginning of the war, about 1,500 refugees from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Sumy, Odesa, Chernihiv, and Poltava oblasts have been admitted to our church. etc. Our sisters make blanks in the kitchen, bake various pastries. We also pack food packages, take them to the east of our country and distribute them to people! Thank God that even in this difficult time we can serve!

The Church of the Divine Revival of Kropyvnytskyi thanks you for your support. Due to the war in our country, many people can not find work, and therefore are unable to rent housing and are forced to stay in a social center for the homeless. Our church helps such people with food. We also financially supported the family of Roman Sementsov, a volunteer who died at the Kramatorsk railway station during a rocket attack.

We brought them food and gifts for the children. Witnessed to God. We talked to them several times a day, and they themselves wanted to come to our meeting.

Dear friends and partners, we truly thank you for your care for our church at this difficult time for our country! We wish you God's abundant blessings, may the Lord reward you for your sacrifice! Our village Stepnogorsk is in the "gray zone" almost from the very beginning of the war, there is no water from the very beginning, light and heat disappear very often. Many people lost their jobs and social benefits due to the war, so we organized the distribution of food aid, which was a significant and timely support to many people. Many unbelievers came to church not only to receive help, but also to hear the healing words of God's love, which they were able to receive in a tangible way through the help they provided. We pray that the Lord will touch the hearts of these people and that these difficult times will help them to save their souls. The funds provided were also used to order, purchase and deliver medicines from other cities, as the village has very limited access to the necessary medicines. People were very grateful, because many elderly people need constant medical support. Assistance was also provided to the elderly with diapers and nappies, the supply of drinking water, transportation of people and assistance to soldiers with food. Thank you again for the opportunities and pray for peace in the country and in the hearts of the people!

Thank you very much for your support, it is very important for us. Thank God we were able to accept about 100 refugees from different eastern and central regions of Ukraine. Some have gone abroad, some remain in our city. The Lord helps us in the House of Prayer to receive up to 25-30 people at a time, thanks to your help we can support them and vote, may the Lord reward you a hundredfold.

From the first day of the war, EHB Kalynivka opened the doors of DM as a bomb shelter for locals and refugees from Chernihiv who were provided with food, medicine, and comfortable living conditions. The ministers of the Church, having funds, supplied medicines to Chernihiv and evacuated people back. The church also provided assistance to the Ter Defense Forces uniform, clothing, gloves, socks, field, cauldrons, medicines, flashlights. Many thanks to the Samaritan Bag Mission for financial support. May the Lord bless your ministry.

We are looking for abandoned houses where no one lives, tidying up and settling refugees. We provide food and everything you need. These people come to church grateful to us and to God, listening to the message of salvation. We also prepare loads of food (pies, bread, stews) and take them to areas where there are fights.

Dear parterres. Thank you, Jesus Christ, for your generous contribution to the ministry of our Church. 1. The youth of the Church served the refugees in cars on the road, making hot tea and food. Also preaching the gospel. 2. During the service of our headquarters for displaced people, we served about 900 people. Taking them, providing food and shelter. In addition, we talk about spiritual topics. Already 8 people from the settlers were baptized. 3. We send products to Kharkiv and Kyiv. 4. We periodically deliver products to the kitchen, which prepares lunches for migrants living at the base, about 15 km from Ternopil. (90 people). On this basis we hold services, at dinner, after the service of our church. 5. Today, 7 people live on the premises of the Church on a permanent basis. Food and services at our expense. Bible studies are underway. 6. We supply food kits to people who have lived in the Church and now live with our brothers and sisters. We take care of about 8 families. They began to attend services. 7. Every week we decided to give an additional blow to 10 more refugee families who will come to the headquarters. 8. We have a day center for children from Ternopil and children who have moved from hot spots. 9. The Church has organized a Football Club for teenagers and young people from displaced families. May the Almighty bless you. Sincerely, Igor Belorus Ternopil RO ECB "Evangelical Church of Jesus Christ"

DEAR FRIENDS! IN spite of everything, OUR CHARITY KITCHEN-DINING ROOM WORKS. In this difficult time for everyone, this is our help to the native state and its people. And our chefs and volunteers are dedicated to this front. Last week alone, almost 900 people were fed. 88 of them will be transported through social services for the seriously ill. Thank God for giving each of us the strength today to cope with the challenge before us. Thanks to the donors of Samaritan's Purse International Relief, thanks to you, our common cause continues to grow and bear good fruit for the glory of God.

We greet you! Thank God, and a big thank you to Samaritan's Bag Mission for your help! Thanks to your funds, we were able to provide food and material assistance to many migrants located on our territory (the city of Kremenchug and the town of Gradizhsk), as well as those located in hot spots (Chernihiv and Kharkiv regions). All this help has been a great blessing during this difficult time for us and the people we were able to help. With respect to you, ministers and employees of the city of Kremenchug "Church of Hope". May God bless you for your open hearts and send us all PEACE!!!

Sometimes people are ready to donate something, to share something, but they do not know how to do it, to whom and where to take it. When we started helping refugees, I posted a photo on Facebook, fellow villagers started writing and calling - offering their help. Now I have a kind of mini volunteer center at work. People bring everything they want to share, and those who need it come and get it.

Thanks to your support, we can help people who have left their homes due to the war with Russia. This includes accommodation and meals, personal hygiene and clothing. And also, if necessary, we take our own transport to the border with Poland. Also, the sisters from our church of Golgotha bake buns every day and we distribute them at the train station and in the schools where the refugees are.

From the second day of the war, our small church began to actively help the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On the second day of the war, Russian forces attacked a military unit 21 kilometers from us. The remnants of the military unit of soldiers and equipment arrived in our village in the evening. The next day we were already gathering food for the soldiers and everything we needed. We had $ 1,500 to renovate the House of Prayer. So we decided to help the army, territorial defense, refugees, because if the Russians come to us in the village, it will not need repairs. So I bought food for soldiers and defense, clothes for volunteers, food for refugees.

First I want to express my deep gratitude for your hearts and care for us. During the war, our church helped families helping refugees from the hot spots in Eastern Ukraine. Namely, the supply - clothes, shoes, food, hygiene products, mattresses and medicines. Many left without anything, some do not even have documents. Once again, thank you so much for helping us not lose heart and see the hand of God through you. God bless you all!

Youth Creative Center and churches in Razdelnaya and Razdelyansky district of Odessa region are very grateful for your help and support in such a difficult time for all of us. Your help was very timely, in the first weeks of the outbreak of hostilities, we evacuated mothers from their children abroad. Our churches are located in close proximity to the border with Transnistria. Also, our family-type shelter and large families were transported to the interior of the region. Razdelnaya is a major railway junction in Ukraine and a strategically important point. We are engaged in the delivery of food and medicine to those in need. We have organized a help point in churches, we distribute food, things, we provide accommodation for the night, we gather children and teenagers, we conduct classes with them, meals are also organized. Organized assistance in sending abroad, mainly mothers with children. Now our shelter is preparing to accept children, there is a large family in which two children died during a fire, because. the state orphanage was taken abroad, and the children arrive on the spot and they need to be identified. Our volunteers sew first-aid kits, which we fill with medicines and distribute to those in need, and sent to Kherson when we had the opportunity. Many of our parishioners are at the forefront as the Ministry of Emergency Situations, doctors, volunteers, we support them with everything they need. We continue to work and trust in our God, we pray for the speedy end of this war, we ask God for strength. May the Lord reward you a thousandfold for your support and kindness. We believe that everything will be fine. With gratitude, Chairman of the Youth Creative Center, Pastor and minister of the churches of the Razdelyansky district Mishchenko R.V., Mishchenko V.I., Bezhenar A.V..
